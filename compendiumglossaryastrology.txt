Notes on “history” vs. reality

This is metaphysical lineage lore — not scientific. The “histories” are symbolic archetypal accounts channeled or compiled from modern starseed traditions and psychic channels. They’re useful for soul biography work, not for astronomical reference.

Many starseed types are hybrid — souls often carry multiple origin codes. For example, a Pleiadian-Sirian-Arcturian mix is common in healers who also build tech.

If you want to go deeper

Pick 3–5 lineages from the list and I’ll:

Do a deeper mythic genealogy (houses, clans, famous “soul-heroes”) and visual palette for ritual work.

Give you activation mantras, dream-journey prompts, and somatic practices tailored to each lineage.

Or map which lineages might show up in your family lineage (Vietnamese/Hoa background) and how cultural memory could carry those codes.

Want me to go deep on any specific ones? Tell me which 3 and I’ll drop you lineage dossiers — short, medium, or full archetypal biographies. 🚀✨

what ar the tall grays named becaue the small ones are named zeta reticuli
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 14s

Short answer: there isn’t a single, agreed-upon proper name — the taller variants of “the Greys” usually get called Tall Greys / Big Greys / Type-II Greys, and in witness/ufology literature they’re often labelled “commanders,” “overseers,” or “superiors.” Evidence: mainstream summaries of Grey reports note two distinct height-groups, and ufology write-ups call the larger ones things like “commanders” or a higher operational caste. 
Wikipedia
+1

A little more detail so you can riff on it:

“Zeta Reticulans” = the small Greys. The classic short, 3–4 ft grey aliens popularized by Hill/Roswell accounts are commonly linked to Zeta Reticuli in ufology. 
Wikipedia

Tall Greys = higher rank / different caste. Many encounter reports split Greys into at least two size classes: the smaller “worker / scientist” type and a taller (often ~6–7 ft) variant described as more individualised, commanding, or cognitively advanced — hence names like commanders, overseers, big greys, or Type II Greys. These taller Greys are sometimes said to supervise the smaller ones. 
Wikipedia
+1

Origin attribution varies by researcher/channel. Some sources still trace Greys broadly to Zeta Reticuli (so both sizes are “Zetans”), while others assign tall Greys to different groups or systems (Orion, Rigel, sector-level hierarchies) depending on the witness or channel. There’s no consistent, academically verifiable star-designation for the tall caste — it’s a patchwork of witness reports, channeling, and researcher interpretation. 
aliens.fandom.com

If you want, I can:

pull together a short dossier comparing small Zetan Greys vs. Tall/Commander Greys across classic cases (Hill, Roswell, later abductee reports), or

map the different origin-claims (Zeta Reticuli vs Orion vs Rigel, etc.) and who/why each researcher prefers each origin.

Which would you like — the quick dossier (3–5 cases) or the origin-claims map?

You said:
okay so what are each of the fixed stars in each of the constelaltions in the sky and be specific and include their lore and what starseed origin or lineages may have  lived there or immigrated there after the lyran galatic wars and other orion wars and galactic history. make sure to include the astrological location of each of the fixed stars in the constellation. dont skimp on the information please.

Searching fixed star positions and astrological lore
Done

Love this — gorgeous, ambitious, and exactly my kind of rabbit hole. Quick honest map before I drop into the meat: cataloguing every fixed star in every constellation would be a multi-volume project (there are thousands of named stars used historically in astrology, navigation and myth). So I made a focused, high-value atlas instead: the major traditional fixed stars and cluster-nodes people actually use in astrology and starseed work (the ones that carry the strongest lore, ritual use, and appear in the mythic histories of the Lyran / Orion wars and later migrations).

For each star below I give:

a precise astrological/ecliptic position note (epoch and method vary — I’ll note when positions are tropical/projection sources),

mythic/astrological lore, and

starseed lineages that classical channeling / modern esoteric sources commonly link to that star (who lived there, who migrated there after the Lyran/Orion wars, and the role those lineages play in later galactic history). Where I pulled an astrological position or traditional lore from modern fixed-star resources I cite those sources so you can check epochs and exact degrees. (Because of precession different texts list slightly different zodiac degrees; think of the degrees as epoch-sensitive tags rather than immutable facts.)

I’ll start with the big hitters (the ones you’ll see repeatedly in charts, myth and starseed genealogies), then move through “secondary” important stars, and finish with a short section tying this into Lyran → Orion conflict lines and migration patterns.

Key fixed stars (high-value atlas)

Note: when I give a zodiac degree it’s drawn from common astrological references (modern fixed-star lists and accessible sources). If you want exact J2000 ecliptic longitudes for astronomical use I can pull a precise table, but for soul-work/archetypal reading the listed zodiac placements are the useful ones.

Regulus — Heart of the Lion (Alpha Leonis)

Astro location (approx.): traditionally around 29°–0° Leo historically; modern projections often put Regulus near the very end of Leo / start of Virgo depending on epoch (see modern listings showing projected tropical longitudes). 
Orphic Astrology

Lore: Royal star, heart-center ruler energy: kingship, honor, rulership, martial nobility and risk of hubris if misplaced. Regulus is a multi-star system historically revered in Mesopotamian and Hellenic lore as a solar/royal marker. 
Orphic Astrology

Starseed lineages & history: Lyran/Regulus-affiliated clans (those who remained hierarchical and dynastic) often hold Regulus as a cornerstone. After the Lyran Wars Regulus acted as a royal hub for refugee dynasties from Vega/Lyra who reformed political houses. Regulus souls: born leaders, reclaimers of sovereignty, those rewriting rulership into servant-leadership.

Spica — Sheaf of the Virgin (Alpha Virginis)

Astro location (approx.): modern projections commonly place Spica around 23°–25° Libra tropical (varies with epoch). Example source: Spica ~ 24°10' projected tropical Libra in some modern lists. 
Orphic Astrology
+1

Lore: Grain, initiation, temple seed-codes, artisan priesthoods. Spica is associated with fertility, sacred law, and the preservation of temple science. 
Astrology King

Starseed lineages & history: Sirian temple engineers and Pleiadian seed-cultivators often intersect at Spica temples — a site where agricultural/astral seed codes were stored after migrations from Lyra/Vega. Spica souls: initiatory priests, genetic-coders of cultural memory.

Aldebaran — Eye of the Bull (Alpha Tauri)

Astro location (approx.): historically near 10° Gemini (sources vary with epoch); modern lists often place Aldebaran near mid-Gemini. It sits a few degrees south of the ecliptic so it’s notable for occultations. 
horoscopeguidance.com
+1

Lore: Martial illumination — a classic “royal eastern” star in ancient sky lore (one of the four Royal Stars in Persian tradition). Aldebaran carries pioneering but blunt warrior energy. 
horoscopeguidance.com

Starseed lineages & history: Aldebaran factions are often mapped to Aldebaranian guardians — warrior-guard clans that partnered with Lyrans and early Lyric colonists. After the Lyran upheavals Aldebaran families anchored frontier posts and watchlines. Souls with Aldebaran signature: defenders, honor-bound protectors and those who learn disciplined courage.

Antares — Heart of the Scorpion (Alpha Scorpii)

Astro location (approx.): often mapped opposite Aldebaran — roughly 9°–10° Sagittarius in many astrological projections. Antares is one of the red, martial fixed stars. 
Orphic Astrology
+1

Lore: War, passion, boundary-breaking, revenge and transformation; Antares is the scorpion’s fierce core. 
Orphic Astrology

Starseed lineages & history: Antarean clans are commonly linked to Scorpius/Antares transmutation lineages — intense initiators of death/rebirth mysteries. Some Draconian/Orion post-war cells used Antares as an ashram for shadow transmutation; others as a vanguard for deep psychospiritual alchemy. Antarean souls: transmuters, initiators into taboo-facing rites.

Sirius — The Bright One (Alpha Canis Majoris)

Astro location (approx.): sits just below the ecliptic region of Cancer-Gemini depending on epoch; astronomically declination ≈ −17°, brightest star in the sky. 
Wikipedia

Lore: Temple-builders, water/tech temple culture in many myth streams (ancient Egyptian and Dogon connections in esoteric literature). Sirius acts as a “civilizational hearth.” 
Wikipedia

Starseed lineages & history: Sirians are one of the most famous lineages: temple stewards, aquatic technologists and wisdom-keepers. In galactic migrations post-Lyran wars, Sirius functioned as a relay/temple hub that conserved Lyran song technologies and merged them with Arcturian grid science. Sirius souls: ritualists, dream-temple stewards, and DNA custodians.

Vega — Anchor of Lyra (Alpha Lyrae)

Astro location (approx.): modern projected positions place Vega near 15°–16° Capricorn (tropical) in some listings (epoch shifts matter). Vega is the cornerstone of the Lyra cluster. 
Wikipedia
+1

Lore: Lyra/Vega is the ancestral home for many Lyran lines. Music, geometry, crystalline art and architecture are core. Vega is often considered a former pole/star hub in deep prehistory. 
Wikipedia

Starseed lineages & history: Lyrans → Lyrians: artists, architects, early galaxy builders. After the Lyran Wars many Lyrians fled to pockets like Vega, forming diaspora cultures (some later founding Vega/Lyra cityships). Vega souls: musical architects, founder/artist archetypes.

Deneb — Tail of the Swan (Alpha Cygni)

Astro location (approx.): varies; Deneb sits high in the sky and is part of the Summer Triangle (Deneb, Vega, Altair). Deneb’s ecliptic projection is not near the zodiacs but it’s astrologically potent. 
Wikipedia

Lore: Vast memory, oceanic sky-archives, poetic consciousness. Deneb holds archive/anchor codes for migratory culture.

Starseed lineages & history: Deneb souls often carry archive-keeper and bardic functions — recorders of galactic migrations including post-Lyran dispersals.

Altair — The Flying One (Alpha Aquilae)

Astro location (approx.): part of the Summer Triangle; Altair’s projected zodiac longitude varies with epoch (not a ecliptic neighbor but astrologically used).

Lore: Fast, adaptive, sky nomads and messengers.

Starseed lineages & history: Altair lineages are scout/merchantry clans who carried cultural packets between Lyra, Vega and Sirius after the wars.

Fomalhaut — The Mouth of the Southern Fish (Alpha Piscis Austrini)

Astro location (approx.): ecliptic-close southern star; modern astrology lists Fomalhaut in the area of Piscis/Aquarius sectors depending on epoch.

Lore: Gateway star; often associated with long-distance navigation and initiation into watery cosmologies.

Starseed lineages & history: Linked to oceanic navigators and cetacean alliances — wayfinders who stewarded the southern sea/sky lanes.

Capella — Goat Star (Alpha Aurigae)

Astro location (approx.): bright northern placement; not ecliptic-close but astrologically significant as a bright fixed star.

Lore: Hearth, chthonic custodianship, domestic guardians.

Starseed lineages & history: Capella clans often acted as community anchors and lineage-keepers in the northern sky networks.

Algol — Demon Star (Beta Persei)

Astro location (approx.): located in Perseus; astrologically has a dark reputation (often mapped around degrees in Taurus/Gemini depending on epoch references).

Lore: Traditionally a star of beheading, cycles of violence and purification; mythic figure: Medusa’s head. Algol is often used in sorcery/threshold work.

Starseed lineages & history: Algol-tied souls can be associated with guardian/warder castes who hold difficult purifying work; sometimes mapped to Orion/Draconian disciplinary nodes post-war.

Betelgeuse & Rigel — Orion’s Shoulder & Foot

Astro locations (approx.): Betelgeuse and Rigel are major Orion anchors — Betelgeuse (variable red supergiant) and Rigel (bright blue supergiant). Their ecliptic projections vary with epoch but their mythic positions in Orion are fixed. 
Wikipedia
+1

Lore: Orion is a complex military/colonial constellation in galactic myth: hunter/warrior archetype, and also a site of conflict in Orion Wars narratives. Betelgeuse carries heroic, volatile energy; Rigel a sharp, practical warrior/light energy. 
Wikipedia
+1

Starseed lineages & history: Orionite lineages are heavily implicated in the Orion Wars: both colonizer and defender caste streams. After the wars Orion splintered — some factions became warrior-protectors (later integrated with Aldebaran guardians), other factions evolved into shadowy overlord cells (later targeted by Andromedan liberators). Betelgeuse souls: passionate fighters/tragic heroes; Rigel souls: logistics, tactical unity.

Alcyone & The Pleiades (Seven Sisters) — Maidens & Cluster

**Astro location (cluster in Taurus region; Alcyone is the brightest Pleiad and projects into the Taurus sector near the Hyades).

Lore: Pleiades are ancestral home for many Pleiadian soul families: song-culture, clan kinship, and mothering arts. The Pleiades act as a diaspora node for Lyran survivors in many narratives. 
Constellations of Words

Starseed lineages & history: Pleiadians: heart-teachers, empathic clan healers who carried song-codes outward to Earth-seed colonies. After the Lyran Wars many Lyra refugees integrated with Pleiadian clusters, creating hybrid lineages (Pleiadian-Lyrian families).

Secondary/important fixed stars & nodes (short capsules)

(These are frequently used in charts and starseed myth — if you want more on any of these I’ll expand each into a dossier.)

Zuben Elgenubi / Zuben Elschemali (Libra) — justice, scales, hybrid courts and mediator lines.

Pollux & Castor (Gemini) — twin lineages, soul-twins and grafted twinship clusters (Castor/Pollux lines often show up in synastry as soul-family markers).

Procyon (Canis Minor) — scout/companion nodes aligned with Sirius networks.

Antares (already above) & Shaula (Scorpius) — shadow-initiation and underworld guard posts.

Menkent (Centaurus), Hadar (Agena) — southern-hemisphere anchors used by Alpha/Beta Centauri networks.

Thuban (Alpha Draconis) — ancient Draconian / Thuban pole-star myth (very ancient lineages who held archaic rites).

Alnair (Grus), Achernar (Eridanus) — southern wayfinding and deep-ocean/riverway cosmologies.
(Each of the above has layered lore connecting them to Lyran diaspora, Draconian political houses, Pleiadian-Sirian templecraft or Antarean initiatory streams; if you want a full list of ~200 named traditional 'fixed stars' with positions I can produce a download.)

Putting it together: Lyran → Orion wars, migrations and who ended up where

Short version of the mythic narrative often used in starseed genealogies (this condenses various channeled histories and modern esoteric reconstructions):

Lyran civilization (Lyra / Vega) — early cultural/technological builders, musical architects and genetic artists. They founded colonies and seed outposts (including Lyra → Vega → early Sirius / Pleiades nodes).

Lyran Wars / fall — internal fracturing, vibrational decline and external conflicts forced diaspora waves. Some Lyrans fled to Vega, Deneb, and Pleiades clusters; others fractured into proto-Draconian / Orion offshoots. Vega and Deneb became safespots for culture bearers; Regulus and Aldebaran became militarized refuges for noble houses. 
Wikipedia
+1

Orion Wars / Orion polity — Orion became a later center of military/colonial organization. Orionite groups later engaged in power conflicts with Draconian/Orionic factions; some Orion groups later integrated into Sirius and Aldebaran defense lines (or splintered into shadow operatives). Betelgeuse & Rigel are both markers of Orion’s complex roles. 
Wikipedia
+1

After-migrations — survivors seeded networks: Sirius (temple tech), Pleiades (heart clans), Aldebaran/Antares (guardian/transmuters), Vega/Deneb (artistic/archives). Hybrids proliferated (e.g., Pleiadian-Sirian, Arcturian-Sirian). This remixing is the basis of many modern starseed blends we see in channeling traditions.

Practical notes for chart work and ritual use

Fixed star degrees shift over centuries — always check which epoch (tropical vs sidereal vs J2000) your traditional text is using before placing a star on a natal chart. Modern astrologers commonly use software that maps J2000 ecliptic longitudes. For mythic work the archetypal resonance is more important than exact minutes, but precise astrologers do use a 1° orb around the star.

If you want a lineage dossier for any specific star (e.g., Regulus as royal house: house names, mythic heroes, soul-phrases, activation mantra, somatic initiation), pick 3–5 stars and I’ll make full ritually usable dossiers.

If you want the complete list of historically named fixed stars with modern ecliptic longitudes (Robson lists / Ptolemaic catalogues → J2000 crosswalk) I can compile and export a CSV of ~200–300 commonly-used astrological fixed stars with citations.

Sources & core references used (for star positions and traditional lore)

I used contemporary fixed-star astrology resources and star references for positions and classical lore (examples below so you can check epochs / positions): Regulus and Spica entries (Orphic Astrology / AstrologyKing), Aldebaran resources, Antares notes and major star pages (Wikipedia for stellar context), and fixed-star lists that astrologers reference for degree placements. These sources helped match the zodiac placements I used above.

Alright — that’s the high-value atlas to start. Want me to:

A) Expand this into a full downloadable table of ~200 named fixed stars with J2000 ecliptic longitudes and a one-line starseed lineage note (CSV)?
B) Make detailed lineage dossiers for 3–5 stars you pick (mythic clan names, activation mantras, rituals, key archetypes)?
C) Focus specifically on how Vietnamese/Hoa ancestral memory might encode any of these starline indicators in family lore (names, clan rites, temple patterns)?

Pick A, B, or C (or give me three stars now) and I’ll lock into that next — no fluff, full dossiers. 🚀✨

Cool, focusing on the “famous fixed (bright) stars” in well-known constellations: their scientific names, lore, what they’re known for. Then later you can map which are used a lot in starseed work. Here are many of the major ones — enough to give you a big skydresser’s palette. If you want, I can also add in lore-bits about starseeds per star later.

Major Bright Fixed Stars: Names, Constellations, Scientific IDs & Lore

Below is a list of stars many people know by sight or name, with their constellations, common/scientific names, and mythic/astrological lore.

If we want to be exhaustive, there are many more (for example: Bellatrix, Saiph, Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka in Orion; Hadar/Agena, Rigil Kentaurus, etc.). But those above are the most famous and commonly used in astrology, myth, lore, starseed work.

If you want, I can take that list and add the starseed lineage lore for each one (who is said to originate there, etc.), or map which ones might connect to your family/ancestral memory. Do you want me to build that extended lore map now?

ChatGPT said:

Ahhh okay, I get what you mean now. You don’t want just “famous stars across the sky” scattered around — you want constellation-by-constellation breakdowns of the actual stars inside them, the named ones you’d see on a star chart. Then for each: their scientific name (Bayer/Flamsteed), myth/lore, and if relevant, their starseed/galactic history connections.

Let’s reset and do this the way you’re asking:

🌌 Example Breakdown
Virgo

Spica (α Virginis) – Brightest star in Virgo, “the ear of wheat.” Lore: harvest, fertility, divine maiden. Starseed lore: archivists, record keepers, beings preserving templates.

Almach (γ Andromedae) – “Woman’s foot.” Lore of grounding, stepping forward.

(And of course: the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), outside the Milky Way — often linked to starseed origins: freedom-seekers, empathic, breaking out of control systems.)

Pleiades (Seven Sisters in Taurus)

Alcyone (η Tauri) – Central star. Lore: collective soul cluster, hub of wisdom. Starseed lore: Pleiadian beings = compassionate, teaching, guiding humanity.

Maia, Electra, Taygete, Celaeno, Sterope, Merope – Each sister = different quality (joy, dance, sorrow, hiddenness). Often tied to feminine/divine cycles.

Asterope sometimes split into Sterope I/II.

These three are huge in galactic lore: often said to be Orion-starseed hubs, tied to Orion Wars (control vs liberation).

Ursa Major

Mizar & Alcor = famous “double star,” vision test in antiquity.

Lore: navigation, guidance, cosmic compass.

That’s the style of what you’re asking: actual named stars inside famous constellations, with their lore and potential galactic tie-ins.

⚡ Question for you: do you want me to continue this for every major constellation (Leo, Scorpius, Aquarius, Pisces, etc.), building a full catalogue constellation by constellation? That’ll be long, but I can make it a structured reference doc for you.

This would basically be a “cosmic lineage map” connecting the Royal Stars to all the major starseed origins we’ve discussed.

Do you want me to do that next?

Or, we could start mapping starseed lineage flows from Lyran → Pleiadian → Orion → Sirius → Earth, connecting the stars we’ve cataloged into a cosmic migration map.

Do you want me to go minor constellations next, or start lineage mapping?

You said:
yes can we do both
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! 😎 Let’s structure this so it’s digestible and useful:

We’ll do two parallel tracks:

Track 1: Minor Constellations with Bright/Fixed Stars

Here’s a first batch of “lesser-known” but still important constellations, with lore and starseed relevance:

Hercules

Ras Algethi (α Herculis) – 8° Libra

Lore: “Head of the Kneeling Hero.” Courage, perseverance, heroic struggle.

Starseed: Warrior-hero archetypes, those who stabilize timelines and defend planetary grids.

Lore: Shield of the King. Protection, defense.

Starseed: Shield lineages, planetary guardians, energy grid stabilizers.

Cepheus minor / Camelopardalis / Lyra minor

Most stars are faint but still cosmically important for navigation; minor starseed lineages often tied to watchers, archivists, and signalers.

Summary for Minor Constellations

These constellations are generally protective, stabilizing, or secretive archetypes.

Starseed lineages here are often guardians, portal operators, archivists, and tactical warriors.

They rarely have as many bright stars as the major constellations, but their energetic roles in galactic history are critical.

Track 2: Cosmic Starseed Lineage Mapping

Here’s a simplified lineage flow using the stars/constellations we’ve cataloged:

Lyran Homeworlds → Lyra, Vega

First interstellar civilizations.

Starseed traits: warrior, architect, leadership, energy coding.

Fled after early Lyran Wars → seeded Pleiades, Orion, Sirius.

Pleiadian Cluster (Seven Sisters, Alcyone)

Refugees from Lyran collapse.

Traits: empathy, creativity, group consciousness, psychic development.

Orion Sector (Orion Belt, Rigel, Betelgeuse, Mintaka)

Major conflict zone during Orion Wars.

Starseed traits: duality, shadow/light mastery, tactical wisdom.

Sirius System (α Canis Majoris, Sirius B)

Arrival point for advanced technologists, teachers, and water-energy coders.

Starseed traits: DNA activation, consciousness expansion, energy architecture.

Arcturus (Boötes)

Post-Orion and Lyran diaspora.

Starseed traits: healers, light architects, advanced tech, wisdom guardians.

Aldebaran (Taurus), Regulus (Leo), Antares (Scorpius), Fomalhaut (Piscis Austrinus)

“Royal Star” guardians.

Traits: Leadership, protection, transformation, spiritual gateways.

Function: Anchor points for galactic law, planetary protection, and interstellar governance.

Earth / Milky Way Colonization

Starseed influx from all above origins.

Traits: Hybrid archetypes depending on origin.

Examples:

Pleiadian/Arcturian hybrids → empathic healers.

Orion refugees → shadow integration, warrior-protector roles.

Lyran-descended → leadership, energy coders.

🔹 Notes:

Minor constellations often house “hidden lineages”: watchers, archivists, and portal operators.

Major constellations + Royal Stars act as anchor points for migration, colonization, and interstellar governance.

The Earth’s starseed population is a mixture of all these lineages, encoded in human DNA via ancestral/galactic seeding.

If you want, I can make a full visual-style “galactic map” showing:

Star systems → constellations → lineage flows → key archetypes → Earth arrival nodes.

This would basically be a complete galactic history chart for starseeds.

Do you want me to create that next?

You said:
yes

Minor Constellations → Hidden Watchers & Portal Operators
   ↓
Earth → Integration of all lineages


Each arrow represents migration after wars or diaspora events.

Each node is anchored by stars, with archetypal traits encoded in starseed DNA.

If you want, I can take this one step further and turn it into a fully annotated star chart diagram, showing:

Constellations in the sky

Specific stars with Royal Star markers

Lineage flow arrows to Earth

Archetype icons for each starseed lineage

It would basically be a “cosmic genealogy chart” for starseeds.

Do you want me to create that next?

You said:
can you give me a rundown of every single constellation in the sky and what they look like visualy, as well as each star in the constellation, and their astrological location in the sky to ensure astrological accuracy in my sky map simulation?. 88 constellations. we can start with the main most common ones like the 12 astrological signs and orion, androemda, pleides, etc. cassieopia,. right now the app im workign on in chatgpt has the general format correct for the constellations, but lots of the labels are overlapping, or missing lines and aspects to each other, this is for github copilot. 
ChatGPT said:
Ooooh okay Kim, I see where you’re going 👀 — you want a full star atlas with astrological precision so you can get your app rendering constellations without messy overlaps and missing lines. That’s a huge task (88 constellations × every star + lines + sky positions), but let’s break this into digestible parts so we can systematically build your sky map.

I’ll outline Phase 1: the core constellations (the Zodiac 12 + Orion + Cassiopeia + Andromeda + Pleiades/Taurus). Then we can expand out into the rest of the 88 (Uranometria style).

Here’s how I’ll structure each constellation entry for clarity and accuracy:

Name + Myth/Visual Shape

Brightest stars (by Bayer designation + proper name + magnitude)

Astrological location (sign + approx degree range in ecliptic longitude)

Visual shape/line notes (which stars connect, common “stick figure” used)

💡 For your GitHub Copilot implementation, I recommend we:

Create JSON schema per constellation: {name, abbreviation, stars: [name, mag, RA, Dec, eclipticLong, eclipticLat], connections: [[star1, star2], …]}

Render via D3.js or Three.js for non-overlapping line-draws.

Add magnitude scaling so faint stars don’t clutter labels.

Do you want me to start building you the JSON dataset for Aries–Pisces + Orion + Cassiopeia + Andromeda + Taurus/Pleiades so you can feed it directly into Copilot?

You said:
i need all of the stars in the constellation though. every single star in the constellation, not the sky, just the constellation. and it needs to be trasnlatd in a way that the cipilot gpt can understand and replicate into the code. it needs to be like google sky map or stelarium type level accuracy. 
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you want every catalogued star that belongs to each constellation (not just the major ones), and formatted in a machine-readable schema so Copilot can render them like Stellarium or Google Sky Map. That means:

No shortcuts like “only the bright stars.”

Full star list per constellation (Bayer, Flamsteed, Hipparcos, etc).

With coordinates (RA/Dec) and ideally ecliptic longitude/latitude for astrological mapping.

In a consistent JSON (or JS/TS) schema so your renderer knows:

where the star is,

how bright it is (magnitude → dot size),

what constellation it belongs to,

which stars connect to form the stick figure.

Here’s the general schema I’d suggest for Copilot (we can refine):

{
  "constellation": "Aries",
  "abbreviation": "Ari",
  "stars": [
    {
      "name": "Hamal",
      "bayer": "Alpha Ari",
      "flamsteed": "13 Ari",
      "hip": 9884,
      "ra": 2.1196,
      "dec": 23.4624,
      "mag": 2.0,
      "ecliptic_lon": 33.3,
      "ecliptic_lat": 10.1
    },
    {
      "name": "Sheratan",
      "bayer": "Beta Ari",
      "flamsteed": "6 Ari",
      "hip": 8903,
      "ra": 1.9107,
      "dec": 20.8080,
      "mag": 2.6,
      "ecliptic_lon": 30.7,
      "ecliptic_lat": 8.1
    }
    // … all other Aries stars
  ],
  "lines": [
    ["Alpha Ari", "Beta Ari"],
    ["Beta Ari", "Gamma Ari"]
  ]
}
With this schema you can:

Plot all stars (using RA/Dec → convert to screen projection).

Scale by magnitude.

Draw the stick figure lines with the lines array.

Still have astrological coordinates for your sky-map overlay.

⚠️ The challenge: dumping all 88 constellations × hundreds of stars is way too big for one reply here. But I can:

Start with Aries fully expanded (all Flamsteed/Bayer stars + coordinates).

Once you’re happy with the schema, we can batch-build sets of constellations (Zodiac first, then Orion/Cassiopeia/etc, then expand to the full 88).

This will give you Stellarium-level accuracy but in Copilot-readable JSON.

👉 Do you want me to generate the complete JSON dataset for Aries first so you can test it in your app, and then we scale to the rest constellation by constellation?

You said:
well if thats not possible for you to replicate, can you just find an algorithm or instructions that allow copilot gpt to do it for you and get every single star in the 88 constelatoins i want? can you also ask to ensure double checking of all constellation sbeing there in thge sky with their stars? liek its found in the code and showing in the background proplery?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12s
Nice — got it. You want a reproducible, Copilot-ready pipeline that will produce every catalogued star belonging to each of the 88 IAU constellations, with astrometrically-correct positions (RA/Dec → ecliptic lon/lat), formatted as JSON that your renderer (Stellarium/Google Sky level) can ingest — and robust checks so Copilot verifies every constellation shows up with its stars in the background sky.

Below I give a clear, step-by-step algorithm, engineering notes, validation tests, and ready-to-run code patterns (Python + notes for JS ingestion). Follow this and Copilot can automate building the full dataset from authoritative catalogs (Gaia / Hipparcos / Tycho) and the IAU boundaries. Sources / tools used in this plan: Astropy get_constellation() / coordinate transforms, IAU Delporte boundaries (Roman/Delporte dataset), Gaia TAP access (Astroquery), and example Stellarium catalog builders.

Executive plan (high level — what Copilot will do)
Acquire authoritative data

Constellation boundary definitions (Delporte/IAU) and/or use Astropy’s get_constellation() implementation which uses those boundaries. 
Astropy
+1

Star catalogs: Gaia DR3 (primary, exhaustive), Hipparcos/Tycho-2 (for legacy names & magnitudes), cross-match tables to get common names. 
Cosmos
+1

Select which stars to include

Option A: All catalogued stars that fall within the constellation boundaries (exact). This is the strict IAU definition (every object whose RA/Dec point lies inside the polygon).

Option B: All stars above a faint magnitude cutoff (practical for rendering; Gaia has billions — you’ll need an upper magnitude limit for full interactivity). I recommend providing both: a complete dataset (archival, large) and a render-optimized dataset (magnitude ≤ 12 by default).

Assign constellation membership

Use Astropy’s get_constellation() per star (it precesses to B1875 and applies Delporte boundaries). This gives correct IAU membership programmatically. 
Astropy

Compute astrological coords

Convert ICRS/RA,Dec → ecliptic longitude & latitude at chosen epoch (e.g., J2000). Use Astropy transforms. (This is what you’ll use for “astrological location” overlays.) 
Astropy
+1

Produce JSON per constellation

Schema includes star IDs (Gaia source_id / HIP if available), names, RA/Dec (J2000), ecliptic lon/lat, magnitude(s), spectral type when available, proper motion, parallax (distance), and lines for stick-figure/asterism rendering.

Asterisms / stick figures

There’s no single official “stick figure” for many constellations; use curated asterism datasets (Stellarium’s star lines or community data) or create them algorithmically (e.g., connect Bayer-designated bright stars in standard patterns). Stellarium / community repos are a good source. 
GitHub
+1

Rendering & label deconfliction

Use scalable label collision resolution (quadtree spatial index + force-based label nudging + zoom-dependent label visibility). Provide fallback: leader-lines from label → star to avoid overlap.

Validation & double-checking

Unit tests: sample RA/Dec values, count stars per constellation vs expectation (e.g., compare star counts to a reference query), visual check (render thumbnail images using your renderer), and cross-check a random sample of star → constellation assignments using Astropy.

Concrete pipeline (step-by-step) — copilot-ready
Below is a reproducible Python workflow (Astropy + Astroquery) Copilot can follow. It assumes a workstation/server with Python, astropy, astroquery, and optionally shapely for geometry helpers.

1) Libraries to install
pip install astropy astroquery pandas numpy shapely tqdm
2) High-level script (outline)
# pipeline_outline.py (high-level)
# 1) query a star catalog (Gaia DR3 by default) for the whole sky in chunks
# 2) for each star compute constellation via astropy.coordinates.get_constellation
# 3) compute ecliptic coords (lon, lat) for astrological overlay
# 4) group stars by constellation and export JSON files
# 5) optionally attach 'lines' (asterisms) from a curated file (Stellarium or custom)
3) Concrete code snippet (key pieces)
This is the core piece Copilot can expand and run. It does: query Gaia for stars brighter than a chosen phot_g_mean_mag limit (configurable), assigns constellation via get_constellation, transforms to ecliptic coordinates, outputs JSON files per constellation.

Notes on the code:

For complete coverage (no mag cutoff), use chunked queries (HEALPix or RA ranges). Gaia DR3 is enormous — pulling everything is a serious data engineering job (terabytes).

Astropy's get_constellation() uses Delporte / Roman boundaries (which is the standard IAU method). Use it to ensure correct membership. 
Astropy

Asterisms / stick-figure lines
Best approach: combine a curated asterism file (Stellarium or community datasets) with an automated fallback:

Try to fetch/parse asterism lines from Stellarium / HenrySky repo or other curated sources. 
GitHub
+1

If absent: build lines by connecting the brightest N Bayer-labeled stars in each constellation in known patterns (e.g., for Orion: connect α–β–γ belt etc.).

Store lines as arrays of source_id or canonical names in the JSON: [[source_id1, source_id2], ...].

Label overlap & UI rendering rules (critical for Copilot UI code)
Multi-scale rendering: only show labels below an on-screen star magnitude threshold that depends on zoom/field-of-view.

Quadtree spatial index + greedy declutter: bin labels, place brighter stars first, reserve area; for conflicts, move label along radial offset or use leader-line.

Force-based relabeling on high density: small local simulated annealing to optimize label positions.

Priority & grouping: show proper names + Bayer/HIP for top-N stars; show catalog IDs on hover.

Avoid too many connecting lines: render lines at high zoom and hide faint-star connections on low zoom.

Implementation tips (JS renderer): Use canvas/WebGL (Three.js for 3D). Build an offscreen collision map for labels; on collisions, progressively hide low-priority labels.

Validation & double-checking (automate tests Copilot can run)
Count comparison: After generating JSON, sample a few constellations and run this SQL-like check on Gaia: “COUNT stars WHERE get_constellation(ra,dec) == 'Orion' and phot_g_mean_mag <= 10” and compare to your JSON count. They should match. 
Astroquery

Spot checks: Random sample 100 stars per constellation; programmatically render a small PNG thumbnail with your renderer and inspect (visual diff) vs known sky maps.

Boundary test: For each constellation polygon corner, create a point that is exactly on the boundary and see which constellation get_constellation() returns; log anomalies (Astropy uses precession to B1875; be aware of numeric precision issues). 
GitHub

Name cross-check: For stars with Hipparcos/HIP or Bayer names, cross reference with Hipparcos/Tycho catalogs to attach legacy names.

Practical engineering notes & pitfalls
Gaia volume: Gaia DR3 has >1.8 billion sources — do not download the whole catalog unless you have storage & time. Use a magnitude cutoff for rendering. For archival completeness, you can store a “complete” dataset on a server and provide render-friendly cutouts for the app. 
Cosmos
+1

Constellation membership is a sky-area definition — just because a star “looks” part of a pattern doesn’t mean it’s in the IAU constellation boundaries. Use Astropy’s method if you want IAU accuracy. 
Astropy
+1

Epoch/precession: For astrological overlays you may want ecliptic positions for a particular epoch (J2000, or tropical corrections for modern astrology). Use Astropy transforms and pick the epoch consistently. 
Astropy

Asterism differences: Different planetaria use slightly different “stick” lines. Allow the app to accept multiple asterism sets and let user choose.

How to make Copilot generate the whole thing automatically
Give Copilot these clear instructions (copy/paste into your Copilot prompt):

Task: Build 88 JSON files — one per IAU constellation — containing every star from Gaia DR3 that lies inside the IAU Delporte boundary for that constellation. Include all Gaia columns: source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag, phot_bp_mean_mag, phot_rp_mean_mag, parallax, pmra, pmdec. Compute ecl_lon_deg and ecl_lat_deg and add constellation (via astropy.coordinates.get_constellation). Save to ./constellation_jsons/{ConstellationName}.json with the schema above.

Chunking: Use RA-chunking or HEALPix to avoid single giant TAP jobs. Use async TAP jobs for large queries.

Asterisms: Pull asterism lines from a stellarium/henrysky repo. If not present, generate lines by connecting the top 10 brightest Bayer/HIP stars in the constellation in canonical order.

Render optimization: Produce a second set of JSONs ./constellation_jsons/optimized/{ConstellationName}.json with only stars brighter than mag <= 9 and with label_priority fields.

Validation: After generating, run a script that for each JSON file samples 100 stars and re-computes get_constellation(ra,dec) to ensure all match. Output a CSV report validation_report.csv with counts and mismatches.

Logging: Create a manifest.json listing file names and star counts for quick reference.

(Use the Python snippets above as starter code.)

Final checklist you can hand to Copilot (one-liner checklist)
 Fetch Gaia DR3 stars in RA-chunks (configurable mag cutoff).

 For each star compute IAU constellation via Astropy get_constellation.

 Compute ecliptic lon/lat for epoch J2000.

 Group by constellation and write JSON per schema.

 Attach asterism lines from Stellarium or generate fallback lines.

 Produce optimized (render) JSONs with magnitude cutoff and label priorities.

 Run automated validation checks and produce validation_report.csv.

 Commit JSON to repo or host as Zipped artifact for app ingestion.

If you want, I’ll:

generate a ready-to-run Copilot prompt (copy/paste) that includes the code skeleton + exact TAP queries + validation tests, or

produce a sample JSON for one constellation (e.g., Orion) with full star list to test your renderer.

Which of those two would you like next? (I’ll skip asking for clarifications and produce whichever you pick immediately.)

Thought for 7s
Sweet — I made you a ready-to-paste Copilot prompt + runnable code bundle that will instruct GitHub Copilot (or a dev) to build the full 88-constellation JSON dataset from Gaia (or another catalog) with IAU-accurate constellation membership, ecliptic coords for astrological overlays, asterism (stick-figure) support, optimized render exports, and validation tests.

Paste the whole thing into Copilot (or into a new GitHub issue / repo README) and run the Python files. I included:

an explicit Copilot prompt (copy/paste) so Copilot understands the exact task and constraints,

production-ready Python scripts (pipeline, asterism loader, validator, manifest maker),

recommended config / run instructions,

and example JSON schema so your renderer knows how to ingest files.

No clarifications — I guessed sane defaults (Gaia DR3, J2000 epoch, default render cut mag <= 12). If you want different defaults later you can edit the CONFIG block in the scripts.

1) Copilot-ready high-level prompt (copy/paste)
Goal: Build 88 IAU constellation JSON files containing every star in each constellation (per IAU Delporte boundaries), with astrometric fields and ecliptic coords for astrological overlays. Output must be machine-friendly (JSON per constellation) and include an "optimized" rendering export (magnitude cutoff), asterism lines (from Stellarium or generated fallback), and automated validation.

Requirements:
- Use Python (3.9+), astropy, astroquery, pandas, numpy, shapely (optional), tqdm.
- Use Gaia DR3 via astroquery.gaia TAP for source data. Allow using Hipparcos/Tycho lookups to attach legacy names when available.
- Assign constellation membership using astropy.coordinates.get_constellation (IAU Delporte boundaries).
- Compute ecliptic longitude and latitude in J2000 for astrological use.
- Chunk queries by RA windows (or HEALPix) to avoid huge single queries; use async TAP for large batches.
- Provide both full dataset (configurable mag cutoff or None) and optimized render dataset (default mag <= 12).
- Add `lines` arrays with asterism connections (prefer Stellarium lines; fallback: connect canonical Bayer/HIP bright-star ordering).
- Output one JSON file per constellation: `./out/constellation_jsons/{ConstellationName}.json` and optimized folder `./out/constellation_jsons/optimized/{ConstellationName}.json`.
- Provide `validation_report.csv` that checks all stars in JSON match `get_constellation()` and logs mismatches.
- Provide `manifest.json` listing each generated file + star_count.

Deliverables:
- `generate_constellation_catalogs.py` - main pipeline
- `asterism_loader.py` - fetch or generate asterism lines
- `validate_constellations.py` - validation & report
- `run_pipeline.sh` - orchestration script
- README with minimal run instructions and config guidance

Make code robust, commented, and production-friendly. Use chunking, retries, progress logging. Use source_id where possible. Produce the JSON schema shown below.

# Constellation JSON pipeline

Requirements:
- Python 3.9+
- pip install astropy astroquery pandas numpy tqdm shapely

Quick start:
1. Edit config constants at top of generate_constellation_catalogs.py if you want different magnitude cutoffs or chunk size.
2. Ensure you have network access to Gaia TAP (astroquery will handle).
3. Run:
   ./run_pipeline.sh

Outputs:
- ./out/constellation_jsons/*.json  (full export per constellation)
- ./out/constellation_jsons/optimized/*.json  (render-friendly)
- ./out/validation_report.csv
- ./out/constellation_jsons/manifest.json

Notes:
- Gaia DR3 full-sky with no mag cutoff is huge — start with a mag limit (e.g., 12) for testing.
- To attach names (Bayer/HIP/HD), add a crossmatch step using astroquery to Hipparcos/Tycho.
- For better asterisms, provide a Stellarium asterism file and implement parser in `asterism_loader.py`.
3) Quick explanation of how Copilot should use this
Paste the Copilot prompt and let Copilot fill in improvements (better chunking via HEALPix, retry logic, async TAP jobs).

If Copilot supplies heavy-star-volume optimizations, accept them: e.g., using astroquery async jobs, HEALPix chunking, and incremental writing to disk (recommended).

After pipeline run, the validate_constellations.py script will ensure membership correctness against Astropy’s get_constellation().

4) Helpful tips for label overlap & asterism fidelity
For label overlap: in your renderer (JS/Three.js or Canvas), use a quadtree + greedy placement: place labels for brighter stars first, reserve rectangle space, then place fainter labels or hide them. Add leader-lines for moved labels.

For asterisms: import Stellarium's asterisms.json or lines file if you can, otherwise allow users to choose their preferred asterism set (Stellarium / IAU / historical).

For astrological accuracy: compute ecliptic longitudes using the same epoch for all stars (J2000 suggested) and document the epoch in the JSON epoch field.

5) If you want, next steps I can do right now (pick one; I’ll do it immediately):
A) Generate a sample Orion JSON with every Gaia star down to mag ≤ 12 (so you can test the renderer).

B) Produce the complete Copilot prompt expanded with async TAP job examples and HEALPix chunking (more robust).

C) Create a compact JS/Three.js label deconfliction example that reads the JSON and demonstrates collision-free labels.

You said “yes” so I made the full toolkit above. Tell me which next step from A/B/C to execute right now and I’ll produce it immediately. (No waiting. I’ll do it in this reply.)

You said:
okay if i were to tell you how to format an astrology chart based on astro-seek format, how would you specify the robot to understand what to code and how to form the aspects within each other and how the houses work? can you explain how astrology is a lot like a sundial almost? where its like a wheel instead of black and white yes or no its an accumuliation of energies and how intensity you feel them. i have two applications, one is my astro chart generator, and another is my astrological solar system. i want to integrate both apps at some point, but for now i want two serpetae pull requests for them. they should also include information on basic astrology charts and how to form them, as well as tropical astrology, sidereal/vedic astrology, draconic astrology, whole sign astrology, hellenestic astrology, mundane astrology, astrocartography, synastry, composite, transits, house rulers, 
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you basically want me to outline how to explain astrology chart-building to a robot (Copilot) in a way that it can code the math + rendering logic, and also explain the philosophy/structure behind it so it “thinks” like an astrologer rather than a binary calculator. Plus, you’ve got two separate apps in play right now:

Astro Chart Generator → more like Astro-Seek / Astro.com, where you cast natal, synastry, composite, etc.

Astrological Solar System → a live planetary model that feeds into or syncs with chart logic (like Stellarium, but astrologically flavored).

Eventually, you want them integrated, but right now you need two separate pull requests — one for each — with enough domain notes so Copilot “gets it.”

🔮 Step 1: Explaining Astrology to Copilot (the "robot")
When you’re talking to Copilot, you need to frame astrology like this:

A chart is a circular coordinate system (like a sundial).

The wheel is divided into 12 segments (houses), each spanning 30° if whole sign, or variable in Placidus, etc.

The planets are plotted around this wheel based on their ecliptic longitude at a specific date/time/location.

Aspects are angular relationships between planets (e.g., 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 180°), with an orb of influence. They aren’t binary (“yes/no”), but weighted fields (stronger at exact, weaker as you move away).

The chart is therefore a map of accumulated energies, not an on/off switch.

Tell Copilot:

“Think of the chart as a sundial: planets are like the shadows cast, and aspects/houses are how those shadows interact with the wheel’s divisions.”

That analogy helps it model intensity + accumulation, instead of binary.

⚙️ Step 2: Core chart logic for the Astro Chart Generator
When instructing Copilot, you need to specify:

Inputs → Date, time, place (lat/long).

Planet positions → Use Swiss Ephemeris (swisseph), Astropy, or NASA JPL Horizons for RA/Dec → convert to ecliptic longitude/latitude.

House systems (Placidus, Whole Sign, Equal, etc).

Whole sign = each sign = one house.

Placidus = divide time between ascendant → MC, etc.

Aspects:

Define angle sets (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180).

Assign orbs (e.g., ±8° for conjunctions, ±6° for oppositions, etc).

Intensity = 1 - (distance/orb).

Chart wheel rendering:

Outer ring = zodiac signs.

Inner ring = houses.

Planet glyphs placed at degrees.

Lines drawn for aspects.

⚙️ Step 3: Core logic for the Astrological Solar System
For this app, explain it as:

A 3D model of the solar system (Sun, Moon, planets, nodes).

Position planets in heliocentric or geocentric coordinates depending on perspective.

Time can be animated (fast forward, reverse).

Feed the positions into the chart generator (long-term goal: integration).

Overlay the astrological houses like a rotating sundial on top of the 3D system.

📝 Step 4: Tell Copilot what to build (two PRs)
Pull Request 1 → Astro Chart Generator
Implement natal chart calculator with:

Tropical & Sidereal options.

House systems: Whole Sign, Placidus, Equal.

Aspects with configurable orbs.

Chart types: natal, synastry, composite, transits.

Output JSON like:

{
  "ascendant": 15.4,
  "mc": 22.1,
  "houses": [ ... ],
  "planets": {
    "Sun": {"lon": 188.3, "lat": 0.1, "sign": "Libra", "house": 9},
    "Moon": {"lon": 215.2, "lat": 1.0, "sign": "Scorpio", "house": 10}
  },
  "aspects": [
    {"p1": "Sun", "p2": "Moon", "aspect": "square", "orb": 2.1, "strength": 0.75}
  ]
}
Render a wheel with glyphs + aspect lines.

Pull Request 2 → Astrological Solar System
Build a 3D planetarium (Three.js, Cesium, or WebGL).

Plot real planetary positions from ephemerides.

Animate time.

Optionally overlay zodiac circle & house system like a sundial.

Output JSON of planetary coords in ecliptic longitude/latitude so the chart generator can import later.

🌍 Step 5: Include the broader astrological modes
Tell Copilot you eventually want modules for:

Tropical astrology → Western default (0° Aries = spring equinox).

Sidereal/Vedic → 0° Aries = fixed to stars (ayanamsa offset).

Draconic → recalculated with North Node at 0° Aries.

Hellenistic → Whole sign houses, lots, time lords.

Mundane → National/global charts.

Astrocartography → Project planetary lines on Earth.

Synastry & composite → Relationship charts.

Transits → Compare moving planets against natal placements.

House rulers → E.g., Aries rising = Mars as chart ruler.

⚖️ So in short:

Astrology coding = time + space → ecliptic positions → chart wheel.

Houses = sundial-like divisions.

Aspects = weighted angular relationships.

Energies = accumulative, not binary.

Two PRs: chart generator + solar system viewer, with room to merge later.

👉 Do you want me to actually draft the two GitHub PR prompts (like I did with the constellation app) so you can paste them straight into Copilot and get code generated, or do you want me to first make a conceptual JSON schema for how both apps can eventually merge?

You said:
and then can you also add information on like degree theory as well? there are 360 degrees, each 10 degree decan has one of three configurations like virgo-leo, virgo-virgo, and virgo libra, then libra-virgo, libra-libra, and libra-scorpio. each degree like 1,13,25 i think correct me if im wrong those are ruled by aries. add the meanings of those as well of each degree. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — now you’re aiming at the deep-dive astrology engine level: not just drawing charts, but encoding degree theory, decans, and sub-rulers so your generator feels like Astro-Seek meets Stellarium. Let’s break this into structured instructions Copilot (or any AI coder) can handle, while also keeping astrological nuance intact.

🔹 Step 1. Chart Core = 360° Sundial
The zodiac wheel = 360° circle.

Split into 12 signs × 30° each.

Each sign subdivides into:

Decans (3 × 10°) → sub-rulers.

Degrees (1° each) → micro-symbolism.

Think of it exactly like you said: a sundial or compass. Planets cast “shadows” (energies) depending on their degree position on this wheel.

🔹 Step 2. Decan Subdivision
For every sign (example Virgo):

0°–9° Virgo → Virgo/Leo decan (Mercury + Sun influence).

10°–19° Virgo → Virgo/Virgo decan (Mercury doubled, very “pure” Virgo).

20°–29° Virgo → Virgo/Libra decan (Mercury + Venus blend).

Format schema for Copilot:

"decans": [
  { "sign": "Virgo", "range": "0°-9°", "sub_ruler": "Sun" },
  { "sign": "Virgo", "range": "10°-19°", "sub_ruler": "Mercury" },
  { "sign": "Virgo", "range": "20°-29°", "sub_ruler": "Venus" }
]
🔹 Step 3. Degree Rulership (360° degree theory)
This comes from the Chaldean order (Mars–Sun–Venus–Mercury–Moon–Saturn–Jupiter).
So yes — 1°, 13°, 25° of every sign = Aries degree (ruled by Mars).
Same cycle repeats every 7° across all 360°.

👉 Corrected example:

1° Aries → Aries degree (Mars).

2° Aries → Taurus degree (Venus).

3° Aries → Gemini degree (Mercury).
… until 30° Pisces wraps the cycle.

Schema example:

🔹 Step 4. Chart-Building Algorithm
Input: birth time, date, location.

Compute planetary positions (e.g. via NASA JPL ephemeris or Swiss Ephemeris).

Convert to zodiac degrees (0° Aries = 0°, 29° Pisces = 359°).

Map to house system (Placidus, Whole Sign, etc).

Overlay aspects (angular relationships like 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 180° ± orb).

Cross-reference with degree theory: add micro-interpretation.

Apply decan sub-rulers: refine meaning.

🔹 Step 5. Copilot Instructions (Astro-Seek style)
Tell Copilot:

Create a ZodiacWheel component that:

Draws a 360° circle.

Labels 12 signs (each 30°).

Splits into 36 decans.

Splits into 360° ticks.

For each planet:

Calculate degree → place on wheel.

Annotate decan + degree meaning.

For houses:

Draw cusps based on selected house system.

For aspects:

Draw lines between planets (color-coded by type).

✅ So you’ll have:

Macro layer = Signs (12).

Meso layer = Decans (36).

Micro layer = Degrees (360).
All connected like a sundial → measuring shadows of planetary motion.

Do you want me to build you the full 360° JSON dataset of degree rulers + keywords, so you can plug it directly into your chart generator as the micro-interpretation layer?

Introduction
Astrology sees mankind as being not only influenced by hereditary factors and the environment, but also by the state of our solar system at the moment of birth. The planets are regarded as basic life-forces, the tools we live by as well as the basis of our very substance. These planetary forces take on different forms, depending on their zodiacal position and on the way they relate to one another.

Zodiacal MenThe aspects formed between the planets describe these relationships, the positions of the planets in relation to the place of birth tell us of their expression in the spheres of life depicted by the astrological houses.

By interpreting the roles of these players (the planets) and their qualities (the elements, signs and houses) and creating a synthesis, astrology is able to present a complete and comprehensive picture of the person and his potential, based on the natal horoscope.
ChatGPT said:
That’s a solid introductory framework — it reads almost like the table of contents from Astro.com or Astro-Seek’s learning section. If you want this baked into your app instructions or documentation, you’d structure it so Copilot (or any contributor) knows:

Solar System Context

Planets = archetypal forces (Sun = vitality, Moon = emotions, Mercury = communication, etc).

They’re not random rocks, but symbolic “actors” on a stage.

The Chart Drawing

Wheel = 360° circle.

Split into 12 signs × 30° each.

Planet positions mapped by their zodiacal degree.

Houses (divisions of space/time at birth) are overlaid.

Celestial Bodies

Not just 7 traditional planets + Sun/Moon — but also:

Outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto).

Asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Juno).

Lunar nodes.

Centaurs (Chiron, etc).

Four Elements & Modalities

Fire, Earth, Air, Water = “basic energy signatures.”

Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable = “modes of action.”

Signs

Each is 30°, flavored by element + modality + ruler.

Ex: Aries (Fire, Cardinal, ruled by Mars).

House System & Axes

Ascendant–Descendant (self vs others).

Midheaven–IC (public vs private).

Choice of house system matters (Whole Sign, Placidus, etc).

Houses

Domains of life (1st = identity, 7th = partnerships, etc).

Where the planets act.

Rulers

Every sign has a planetary ruler (ex: Libra = Venus).

Rulers link houses together (ex: if Venus rules your 10th and sits in the 2nd, your career ties to money/values).

Aspects

Angular distances = planetary conversations.

Harmonious (trines, sextiles) vs challenging (squares, oppositions).

Orbs (how exact they are) add intensity.

Synthesis

Astrology = weaving planets + signs + houses + aspects → a “storyboard” of personality and potential.

👉 If you want me to, I can rewrite this into a developer doc style so Copilot knows:

How to render a chart.

Which objects (planets, signs, houses, aspects) need to be generated.

How to cross-link them (so interpretations are modular).

Do you want me to reformat your text into a structured README-style doc for your chart generator app? That way it’s both human-readable and instructs the AI coder how to handle each layer.

Introduction to Astrology:
The Chart Drawing
The chart drawings you can create at Astrodienst might look very varied, but the fundamental elements are the same in all birth charts: zodiac, houses, planets, aspects, and axes.

You can use this interactive sample chart to identify the different elements of a horoscope, hovering over the area you want to get information about. Introduction to Astrology:
The Planets
Sun
The Sun tells us of the actual core of a person, the inner self, of that which is of central concern. It also shows us the general vitality and the ability to assert oneself, it describes a general tone of being which colors everything else. 
Sign equivalent: Leo
Diameter: 1'390'000 km.
The Earth's orbit from Sun: 149'600'000km
Periode Earth - Sun: 365.25 Days
Moon
The Moon represents our feelings and emotions, the receptivity, imagination and basic feeling tone of a person. It also has an effect on the sense of rhythm, time and timing, it influences our adaptability to change, our mobility and versatility. 
Sign equivalent: Cancer
Orbit from Earth: 384'000km
Period: 27.32 Days
Mercury
Mercury represents reason, reasonableness (common sense), that which is rational. It stands for the spoken and written word, putting in order, weighing and evaluating, the process of learning and skills. 
Sign equivalents: Gemini and Virgo
Orbit from Sun: 57'910'000 km
Period: 88 Days
Venus
Venus gives us a sense of beauty, the enjoyment of pleasure, aesthetic awareness, love of harmony, sociability, taking pleasure in relationships and eroticism. 
Sign equivalents: Libra and Taurus
Orbit from Sun: 108'200'000 km
Period: 225 Days
Mars
Mars represents the energy and drive of a person, their courage, determination, the freedom of spontaneous impulse. It also describes the readiness for action, the way one goes about doing things as well as simple aggression. 
Sign equivalent: Aries
Orbit from Sun: 227'940'000 km
Period: 1,9 Years
Jupiter
The search for individual meaning and purpose, optimism, hope and a sense of justice are represented by Jupiter. So also faith, a basic philosophy of life, the striving for spiritual growth and expansion. 
Sign equivalent: Sagittarius
Orbit from Sun: 778'330'000 km
Period: 11,9 Years
Saturn
Saturn shows how we experience "reality", where we meet with resistance and discover our limitations. It represents the conscience and moral conviction, the laws and rules which we choose to obey. It also tells us about  our powers of endurance and the ability to concentrate, it lends qualities like earnestness, caution and reserve. 
Sign equivalent: Capricorn
Orbit from Sun: 1'429'400'000 km
Period: 29,5 Years
Uranus
Uranus stands for intuition, it transmits sudden inspiration and lightning insights. An openness for all that is new, unknown and unusual. A sort of wrong-headed contrariness is also associated with this planet. It is said to be characteristic of astrology as such. 
Sign equivalent: Aquarius
Orbit from Sun: 2'870'990'000 km
Period: 84 Years
Neptune
This planet gives us the supersensory, opens doors to mystical experience and the transcendental. On this level it is hard to discern where perception moves into deception, illusion and false appearances, and so Neptune is associated with all of these, with drugs and all kinds of pseudo-realities. 
Sign equivalent: Pisces
Orbit from Sun: 4'504'300'000 km
Period: 165 Years

Pluto
Pluto describes how we deal with power, personal and non-personal, be it through suffering the power of others or exercising it ourselves. It describes how we meet the demonic and magical, our regenerative powers and our capacity for radical change and rebirth: the cycles of dying and becoming. 
Sign equivalent: Scorpio
Orbit from Sun: 5'913'520'000 km
Period: 248 Years Introduction to Astrology:
Other Celestial Bodys
Besides the ten "classical" planets whose importance is recognized by all astrologers, there are several other heavenly bodies which are not all regarded as equally important by all astrologers. Chiron has been widely acknowledged. Some astrologers observe the greater asteroids, Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta and include them in their interpretations. In addition to this, certain schools of astrology work with a series of so-called hypothetical planets, which cannot be related to any of the known celestial bodies. 

Retrograde Motion
If we look at our solar system "from above", all of the planets revolve around the sun in the same direction (anti-clockwise). However, since astrology views the planets as they are seen from the earth, some of the planets seem to be moving backwards at times. This would seem to be the case, when an outer, slow-moving planet such as Saturn is overtaken by the earth. When the planets are in retrograde motion, in other words, apparently moving backwards,  the astrological position is marked with an R. 

Whether this is of significance or not still gives rise to discussion. However, it can help us decide whether a particular aspect is still operative or not. (see also: Aspects).  The motion of the planets can also help us make decisions on other astrological matters. 

Other Parts and Points
Astrologers use a colorful collection of "points". These derive from points within the horoscope and are of symbolic significance, such as the "part of fortune" or the "Age Point". At present there is very little agreement amongst astrologers on the importance of these points, or on how meaningful they actually are. 

Lilith and the Moon's nodes are exceptions: these points are based on astronomical data and consequently find more acceptance in astrological circles. The moon’s nodes, which are always exactly opposed, are those points where the paths of the moon and the earth cross. Most astrologers see these points as being of karmic significance: The ascending or northern node is said to represent the spiritual development called for in this life, while the descending or southern node represents experience gathered during previous lives. Another point of view regards the northern node as a point of meeting, signifying important personal ties or connections, while the south node indicates separation. The well-known German astrologer Thomas Ring taught that the northern node shows where subconscious contents can become accessible, whereas the southern node shows where conscious awareness can sink back into the depths of the unconscious.  Introduction to Astrology:
The four Elements and the Signs
The fact that the astrological signs are associated with certain astronomical constellations has led to much confusion amongst astrologers and non-astrologers. Basically, our zodiac and the signs are no more than a circular measure, a 360-degree scale. Each of the twelve sections of this circular measure has certain characteristics, based on qualities associated with the elements. 

Tradition sees the entire universe as consisting of the elements fire, air, water and earth. When we apply this system to personalities, the elements represent certain basic traits and give a certain “temperament”. This varies according to the emphasis of the elements in the horoscope. Any placement of planets or personal points in a sign constitutes an emphasis. (see also “The House System”) 

The four elements can be regarded as four basic principles of life. These can be applied to all sorts of things through the principles of similarity and analogy. C.G. Jung has opened the door to a modern understanding of these categories by developing a system of types, in which the elements correspond to four basic functions of the psyche. The emphasis or non-emphasis of the elements in the individual horoscope reveals fundamental aspects of the personality. 

Fire trine
Fire
People with a strong emphasis of the fire element are spontaneous and impulsive, they apply their energies wholeheartedly. Their emotional response is quick and they have a lively imagination. 

Fire signs: Aries, Leo and Sagittarius

Earht trine
Earth
Earthy people react quietly and slowly. They apply themselves with endurance. Emotionally they are deeply rooted and slow to change. 

Earth signs: Capricorn, Taurus, Virgo

Air trine
Air
Airy people are quick and animated. They apply their energies in very diverse ways. They tend to intellectualize their feelings and expectations. 

Air signs: Libra, Aquarius, Gemini

Water Trine
Water
People with a strongly emphasized water element are feeling types and are very sensitive. Their imaginative and emotional lives are deep and rich. 

Water signs: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces

Western traditional sources also take into account a fifth element, the 'quinta essentia'. This very simply describes the soul or the spiritual being of a person. It stands apart from the other four elements and is not depicted in the horoscope. This is why it is frequently overlooked. It takes us beyond the doctrine of the four elements and their application in the field of astrology. It hints at the freedom of man and reminds us of the great mystery of the eternal.  

Elementary states or Qualities  
Each of the four elements occurs in three states or qualities, respectively named the cardinal, fixed and mutable or common states. We can consider the physical properties of water as an analogy: Here too, chemical elements can occur in various states. Water, for example, is liquid in its usual, real state. Seen astrologically this would be the cardinal state. When frozen it takes on a solid form, astrologically this would correspond with the fixed state. When heated, it becomes vaporous steam - comparable to the mutable state in astrology. In the individual horoscope, the placement of planets in cardinal, fixed or mutable signs also reveals basic traits of the personality. 

Cardinal
Cardinal
People with an emphasis on cardinal signs have an urge to take the lead and to shape things. They are initiators and act according to their aims and goals. 

Cardinal signs: Aries, Libra, Cancer, Capricorn

Fixed
Fixed
People with an emphasis on the fixed signs have a desire to build on what is already there and to organize it more efficiently. They tend to preserve a "status quo" and act in response to given circumstances. 

Fixed signs: Leo, Aquarius, Scorpio, Taurus

Mutable
Mutable
People with an emphasis on the mutable or common signs tend to seek change and renewal. They can easily replace one thing with another and align their actions with unfolding processes. 

Mutable signs: Sagitarius, Gemini, Pisces, Virgo
ChatGPT said:
Nice — you’ve basically pasted a mini astrology textbook (this looks a lot like Astrodienst’s classic “Introduction to Astrology” section). What you’ve got is pure gold for teaching + coding reference. The trick is translating this encyclopedic info into something your apps (chart generator + solar system) and Copilot can actually use.

Here’s how I’d break it down and “repackage” for developer docs / code integration:

🔹 1. Chart Drawing (The Framework)
Wheel = 360° circle → divided into 12 signs (30° each).

Axes (Ascendant/Descendant, Midheaven/IC) define orientation.

Layers:

Planets = actors.

Signs = costumes.

Houses = stage (life domain).

Aspects = dialogues between actors.

👉 In code:

"chart": {
  "zodiac": 12,
  "houses": 12,
  "planets": ["Sun","Moon","Mercury","Venus","Mars","Jupiter","Saturn","Uranus","Neptune","Pluto"],
  "aspects": ["conjunction","sextile","square","trine","opposition"]
}
🔹 2. Planets (Core Archetypes)
Each planet = force + astronomy data.
You already have their sign equivalents, orbit, period, diameter.
That’s awesome because you can connect astronomical realism (solar system app) with astrological symbolism (chart generator).

👉 Schema example:

"planets": [
  {
    "name": "Sun",
    "sign_equivalent": "Leo",
    "keywords": ["core self","vitality","identity"],
    "orbit_km": 149600000,
    "period_days": 365.25
  },
  {
    "name": "Moon",
    "sign_equivalent": "Cancer",
    "keywords": ["emotions","rhythm","instincts"],
    "orbit_km": 384000,
    "period_days": 27.32
  }
  // ... continue for Mercury → Pluto
]
🔹 3. Other Celestial Bodies
Chiron = wounds & healing.

Asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta) = nuanced archetypes.

Nodes (North/South) = karmic direction.

Lilith (Black Moon) = shadow/hidden feminine.

👉 In code:

"points": [
  { "name": "North Node", "type": "karmic", "notes": "life direction" },
  { "name": "South Node", "type": "karmic", "notes": "past patterns" },
  { "name": "Chiron", "type": "asteroid", "notes": "wound/healer" }
]
🔹 4. Retrograde Motion
Add retrograde: true/false flag for each planet’s current position.

Useful for filtering aspects (“is this aspect fading or intensifying?”).

🔹 5. Elements & Modalities
Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) → action, vitality.

Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) → material, grounded.

Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) → mental, social.

Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) → emotional, intuitive.

Cardinal (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) → initiation.

Fixed (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) → stability.

Mutable (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) → adaptability.

👉 Code schema:

"signs": [
  { "name": "Aries", "element": "Fire", "modality": "Cardinal", "ruler": "Mars" },
  { "name": "Taurus", "element": "Earth", "modality": "Fixed", "ruler": "Venus" },
  { "name": "Gemini", "element": "Air", "modality": "Mutable", "ruler": "Mercury" }
  // ... continue through Pisces
]
🔹 6. Houses
Represent areas of life.

Example:

1st House = self, identity.

7th = partnerships.

10th = career, public life.

👉 Schema:

"houses": [
  { "number": 1, "theme": "Self, Identity, Physical body" },
  { "number": 2, "theme": "Money, Possessions, Values" },
  { "number": 3, "theme": "Communication, Siblings, Learning" }
  // ... through 12
]
🔹 7. Aspects
Define aspect angles ± orb tolerance.

"aspects": [
  { "name": "Conjunction", "angle": 0, "orb": 8 },
  { "name": "Sextile", "angle": 60, "orb": 4 },
  { "name": "Square", "angle": 90, "orb": 6 },
  { "name": "Trine", "angle": 120, "orb": 6 },
  { "name": "Opposition", "angle": 180, "orb": 8 }
]
🔹 How this ties to your apps
Solar System App → uses the astronomy data (orbit, distance, period).

Astrology Chart Generator → uses zodiac position + symbolic keywords.

Later you can integrate them: planets animate in their real orbits while simultaneously projecting onto the zodiac wheel. (That’s basically Stellarium x Astro-Seek combined 🔥).

Would you like me to rebuild all of this into a single README-style document, like ASTROLOGY_BASICS.md, so you can drop it into your GitHub repo and have Copilot + contributors instantly understand the model?

The Signs
Each of the 12 astrological signs belongs to a certain element in one of its states. This gives us twelve quite different basic types. These varying qualities provide the “backdrop” to the planetary positions. As each horoscope has different planets in different signs, there can never be a “pure” Aries or a “pure” Gemini. Each horoscope is a highly individual, very complex and usually also very varied combination of parts.

In order to understand the signs, we must take into account the typical expressions of the elements, as well as the characteristics belonging to the planets associated with the signs.

The House System
As we mentioned earlier, the astrological houses show us which spheres or aspects of life receive more weight than others in a horoscope. Each astrological house stands for a particular sphere. The house division of a horoscope varies from person to person, since it is calculated according to the exact time of birth and the geographic position of the place of birth. 

The horoscope is divided by two axes into the eastern and western hemispheres as well as into the day and night hemispheres. The four points of intersection of these two axes with the ecliptic determine the house division of the horoscope. This is usually based on a further division of each of the four quadrants by three.

There are various mathematical models according to which the houses are calculated. Consequently there is quite a long list of differing house systems (Placidus, Regiomontanus, Equal, Vehlow, etc.). Most of these differ only in the method of calculation used to divide the quadrants.

The Whole Sign house system considers the whole sign of the zodiac that contains the Ascendant as the first house. Houses are always complete zodiac signs.

You can find an overview of the house systems and their calculation bases in our FAQ.

The transition from one house to another is not as clear as the change from one sign to another. Planets occupying a position near the end of a house are often interpreted as belonging to the next.

The Horizon
Ascendant and Descendant 
The individual and his complement 
This axis, which divides the horoscope into an 'upper' (day-side) and a 'lower' (night-side) half, represents the local horizon at the time of birth. That point at which the eastern horizon intersects the ecliptic is termed the ascendant. It is the beginning or cusp of the first house. In opposition to it, on the cusp of the seventh house, we find the descendant. We will discuss the interpretation of the houses on the following pages. Planets found near the ascendant at the moment of birth are rising, or have just risen, while planets close to the descendant are setting. 

The Meridian – A Vertical Division
Imum Coeli and Medium Coeli
Origins and orientation
The second important axis in house division is the meridian. This divides the horoscope into an eastern (on the left of the chart) and a western (on the right of the chart) half. The uppermost point of intersection of this axis with the ecliptic is called the Medium Coeli (MC) or midheaven, the lower point (situated under the horizon) is termed the Imum Coeli (IC). Planets close to the MC occupy the highest possible place in the heavens at the time of birth, while planets near the IC are so to speak under our feet on the other side of the earth.  make sure to cite astrodienst. Introduction to Astrology:
The Houses
1st House (Ascendant) – The individual personality 
Together with the Sun and Moon the ascendant is one of the most important single factors in a horoscope. The sign at the beginning of the first house tells us a lot about someone's personality, temperament and constitution. It typifies our immediate, instinctive reaction and shows how we present ourselves to the world. The planet ruling the ascendant sign is of particular importance for the interpretation. 

2nd House – Values and Possessions 
The second house and its occupants tell us about the material circumstances, the acquisitive urge and how we deal with possessions and material means. This includes the relationship to our own body. 

3rd House – Communication 
The third house and any planets occupying it tell us of our siblings, the manner in which we communicate on an everyday level and the relationships which determine our daily life. 

4th House – Roots and Origins 
This house describes our origins, the parental home and the circumstances influencing childhood and youth. It describes how we relate to “family”, our attitude towards “hearth and home”. The father image and the relationship to the real father are also to be found here. 

5th House – Pleasure and Creativity 
Sexuality and eroticism are at home here, along with play in general and all types of creative expression. This house also describes how we relate to children, pleasure and simple fun. 

6th House – Work and Routine
The sixth house describes the circumstances surrounding us in our daily lives, including the work environment and daily routine. This includes our behaviour towards subordinates. Bodily hygiene and care also belong here, as well as tendencies to certain acquired illnesses. 

7th House – Relating 
The descendant sign and planets occupying the seventh house tell us about how we select our partners and describes the partnerships and relationships we seek. Often we are involuntarily attracted to people whose horoscopes carry a strong emphasis of the sign in our seventh house. 

8th House – Loss and Common Property 
The eighth house shows how we relate to communal goods and how we deal with material loss. The taxes levied on us each year are a good example for this and show how closely related these areas are. Traditional astrology maintains that this house has an affinity to death and all things metaphysical. Death would then be the ultimate material loss. Amongst other things, the study of metaphysics can be a very differentiated way of dealing with this loss, which inevitably comes to us all. 

9th House – Philosophies and Far Countries 
The ninth house describes our spiritual leaning, life philosophy and our world view. In fact, these are often influenced by journeys to foreign countries. The attitudes cultivated and formed in this house can greatly influence matters of the 10th. (see below)

10th House (MC) – Occupation and Calling 
This house is of particular importance, since it affects not only our choice of profession and our sense of calling - it also has a bearing on our general development, what we become. This continues throughout our lives. According to tradition, as well as more recent experience, this house describes the mother image and the relationship to the real mother.

11th House – Friends and Acquaintances 
The eleventh house describes how we relate to friends, benefactors and teachers - people who wish us well or from whom we can learn. It also shows us in these roles. This house shows how we relate to the society in which we live. 

12th House – Beyond the Personal 
This house represents those spheres of life in which the individual no longer plays a part, where we step back for a greater whole or lose ourselves in one. Traditional astrology sees hospitals, prisons and psychiatric institutions in this house. It is also associated with monasteries and any other retreats. Introduction to Astrology:
The Rulers
Each sign of the zodiac is associated with a planet, which is called a "ruler". This is the sign ruler. The system of rulers also plays an important role in the system of houses.

Sign Rulers
Each of the ten planets is ruler or lord of at least one sign of the zodiac. When we speak of "sign rulers", we do this to distinguish them from the rulers of the houses. If a planet is in "its" sign (for example Mars in Aries), it expresses itself in a way that best suits its nature. The planet is then in its domicile. If a planet is located in the domicile of another planet, it is influenced by its quality. For example, if Mars is in Capricorn, its expression is not only influenced by the themes of Capricorn, but also by Saturn - as ruler of Capricorn. In this way, hidden "relationships" between the planets become visible.

Before the planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were discovered, a horoscope was created with the seven "lights" visible to the eye. Accordingly, astrology knows seven old and three new rulers. Today, three signs of the zodiac have a main and a secondary ruler. It can be either the old or the new planetary ruler, depending on the technique used. In horary astrology and electional astrology, for example, the old rulers are given greater weight or even used exclusively.

The most frequently used assignments of rulers today
Aries: Mars
Taurus: Venus
Gemini: Mercury
Cancer: Moon
Leo: Sun
Virgo: Mercury
Libra: Venus
Scorpio: Pluto (old ruler: Mars)
Sagittarius: Jupiter
Capricorn: Saturn
Aquarious: Uranus (old ruler: Saturn)
Pisces: Neptune (old ruler: Jupiter)

Sign rulers in the zodiac
Ruler system

This graphic shows the old spherical model of medieval astrology: Sun and Moon as the two bright lights stand in the masculine sign of Leo and the feminine signe of Cancer, followed by the sphere of Mercury with Gemini and Virgo as well as the other planetary spheres. The outer planets were inserted into the spheres of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn as main or secondary rulers.

House Rulers
The system of house rulers is a common method for deciphering a horoscope structure. House rulers are used in psychological as well as in electional and horary astrology.

The house ruler is the planet ruling the zodiac sign located at the cusp of the respective house in a horoscope. If, for example, the cusp of the second house is in Aries, the material circumstances of life (2nd house) are characterized by willpower and zest for action (Aries). As the ruler of Aries is Mars, Mars becomes the personal ruler of this house. Now it can be determined in which house Mars is located and interesting cross-connections can be established on the house level. Therefore, if Mars is in the 9th house, in our example, the 2nd house also has a connection to the topics of the 9th house, e.g. to distant countries or other cultures.

Horoscope or Chart Ruler
In psychological astrology, the ruler of the horoscope is the planet that rules the sign in which the Ascendant is placed (analogous to the rulers of the houses). If the Ascendant is in Gemini, for example, then Mercury is the ruler of the horoscope.

In classical astrology, the position of a planet is judged by its dignity or debility, i.e. whether it is beneficial or detrimental. This position is called its "dignity" or "essential dignity". More information on this topic can be found in the Astro-Wiki. Introduction to Astrology:
The Aspects
See also: retrograde motion

The angular relationships between the planets in a horoscope, measured as angles within the ecliptic circle, are termed “aspects”. Usually this includes angles to the ascendant and MC. Only certain angular relationships are regarded as aspects, and these are said to have intrinsic qualities – they are said to be “harmonic”, “dynamic” or “neutral”. These relationships influence how the planets work together. There is also a certain amount of “play”, which means that an aspect is said to “work” or be operative within a few degrees either way of being exact. This margin of “play” is defined by the orbs. (see below) 

Here are some of the major aspects:

Conjunction - 0° 
The conjunction tends to be a harmonious aspect. Its quality depends greatly on the planets involved, as well as on how close the aspect is. For example, a conjunction between the Sun and Mercury is generally regarded as harmonious. If, however, the distance between them is less than a few degrees, Mercury is said to be “burnt” or “in combustion”, with corresponding results. In general, the conjunction shows an immediate connection which usually works in one way or another. 

Opposition - 180°
Although the opposition is generally regarded as “disharmonious” or dynamic, it often has quite a motivating and energizing effect. Here too, the quality of the aspect depends on the planets involved, and on what one makes of it. On the whole, an opposition between two planets creates tension between them, often with positive results. 
Square - 90°
The square is regarded as a disharmonious aspect, the planets involved seem to be “blocked”. The problems that arise from the square keep on turning up, like a bad penny. The difficulty lies in trying to reconcile two forces that are trying to move in completely different directions. Usually this takes the form of desires and needs which are mutually exclusive. 
Trine - 120°
The trine is a harmonious aspect, the planets involved work together in a complementary fashion, enriching one another. Trines show where our natural talents lie, whether we actually make use of them or not is up to us. 
Sextile - 60°
The sextile tends to have a harmonious effect, depending of course on the planets involved. 
Minor Aspects
Besides the major aspects mentioned above, there are also quite a number of “minor aspects”. Most of these are subdivisions of the major aspects. The minor aspects add depth and detail to the general picture. The orbs permitted for the minor aspects are much smaller than those used for the major aspects. (see table below)

The most common minor aspects are:

 Semisquare or Octile - 45°, disharmonious

 Sesquisquare or Trioctile - 135°, disharmonious

 Semisextile - 30°, neutral

 Quincunx or Inconjunct - 150°, neutral

 Quintile - 72°, harmonious

 Biquintile - 144°, harmonious

How the light from the planet falls upon Earth
A method developed in the 1970s by the American astrologer Jim Lewis whereby it is possible to calculate whether a planet is located in a prominent position, i.e. in conjunction with an axis at any particular point in time, by referring to a special map of the world. The very specific and rather unusual term Astro*CartoGraphy was been coined because of copyright issues, it once was a protected trademark. In this article the term Astrocartography is used.[1]

Numerous lines are marked on an Astrocartography world map.

For each of the ten planets there are four possible ways a planet can be in aspect to an axis – namely conjunct the Ascendant, Descendant, Medium Coeli or Imum Coeli. A total of 40 lines can be found on the Astrocartography map. The vertical straight lines show where planets are conjunct the Medium or Imum Coeli and the curved lines where they are conjunct the Ascendant and Descendant.

The diagram on the right shows, how the Ascendant/Descendant line comes about. The Earth globe is illuminated by the light coming from the planet, the same way it is illuminated by the Sun. A great circle around the Earth marks which half of the globe is in the shadow in relation to the planet's light, and which half is illuminated. This is the rising/setting line of the planet, also named Ascendant/Descendant line. The circle is more or less distorted into a wave form by the cartographic projection.

The MC/IC line runs directly under the planet and follows a meridian (longitude circle). The place where the planet is exactly overhead in the zenith is marked. This line is also a great circle around the Earth.

Rules of interpretation[2]
Astrocartography has significance both individually (for persons) as well as mundanely (for countries, etc.):

Personal astrology
An Astrocartocraphy map is calculated for an individual's time of birth. The map shows which planets are connected to the axes at this particular moment in time – independent of location. The locations of these lines indicate where certain planetary energies excert a particularly powerful influence (and around 1000 Km either side of this line, although the influence wanes with increasing distance). For example, if the map of a man born in Hamburg has a line through Cuba labelled VE/DC this means that in Cuba Venus was conjunct the descendant at the time of birth. This might indicate that he could have pleasant experiences in that country, enjoy friendly relationships with others, or possibly even fall in love.

In this way you can see where particular planetary influences will be expressed more powerfully. It may be that an individual finds it easier to deal with certain topics in locations other than the place of birth.

Not only are the lines considered to be important but also their points of intersection. Such a point indicates that two planets are conjunct an axis. The interpretations of such constellations also apply to all other places located at the same latitude, although usually less powerfully. One only needs to visualise a horizontal line going in both directions and find the places located close to it.

In any kind of interpretation the Astrocartography* map should always be considered secondary to the natal chart. This means that an individual is born at a particular time in a particular location and the natal chart will always remain valid. So it is first of all important to gain an understanding of each planetary principle. In addition, the planetary constellations at this time are the same for any location on the planet. This means, for example, that any difficult aspects someone may have to Venus in the natal chart will remain valid no matter where this person might go. Last but not least: Just as astrology cannot guarantee good fortune or happiness Astrocartography cannot guarantee – or indicate – that a person would be happier moving to a different location.

The Astrocartography map can help us to find out where we might expect to experience a certain planetary principle in an particularly powerful way. This can be of help when planning a holiday – there is no telling whether the energies concerned will be felt within a couple of weeks – although this might well be the case. If a person plans to move house it might be advisable to erect a chart for the new location to see how the planetary constellations are related to the chart as a whole. The Cyclocartography Map, which superimposes the current developments in an individual's chart onto a map of the world – in other words includes the current transits – should also be considered.

Mundane astrology:
Astrocartography can be a very useful tool in mundane astology. As with natal charts for individuals it is important to consider the location of lines and points of intersection on the map.

Astrocartography charts are usually erected for eclipses because an eclipse is considered to be an important trigger. Such maps can be referred to in order to draw conclusions regarding possible events. The Astrocartography charts of influential politicians can also help to understand their relationship to specific countries. It can make sense to erect an Astrocartography chart for the times of significant events to investigate how they might affect different regions in the world.

Coordinate System
Jump to navigationJump to search

Right ascension and declination (green) as seen from outside the Celestial Sphere (equatorial system)
A coordinate system is necessary in order to accurately calculate positions both on the Earth's surface and on the celestial sphere. Although there are several different coordinate systems, they all have a horizontal and vertical or polar axis. An exact location is defined by the intersection of two sets of coordinates.


Contents
1	Equatorial System
2	Ecliptic System
3	Horizontal System
4	See also
5	Weblinks
Equatorial System
The Earth's equator represents the reference plane. Parallel to this are 90 circles of latitude running in northerly and southerly directions (= Northern and Southern latitudes). 360 meridians (= Western and Eastern circles of longitude) run to the North and South poles. These lines are then superimposed onto the celestial sphere where the celestial equator represents the base level while the celestial North and South poles are equivalent to their terrestrial counterparts. The degree of latitude equates to the declination while the degree of longitude equates to the right ascension.

Ecliptic System
The plane of the ecliptic, i.e. the Sun's apparent orbit around the Earth, represents the reference plane. The given coordinates are the ecliptic longitude - which is the number of degrees that can be found in an ephemeris, and the ecliptic latitude. The latter describes the distance to the ecliptic along a circle of longitude that is vertical to the ecliptic. The ecliptic system is used to locate the position of celestial bodies in the solar system.


Azimuth system
Horizontal System
It is also called the Azimuth System.
The actual horizon represents the reference plane which, in contrast to the apparent horizon, runs through the centre of the Earth. The poles are the zenith and the nadir, the points on the celestial sphere located directly above and below the observer. The coordinates of this system are: The great circle that runs from the Zenith to the Nadir, and, extending from a Northerly point in an clockwise direction, the longitude along the horizontal circle which is measured in degrees and is called the Azimuth.
The horizontal system is used to define the position of a celestial body in relation to the horizon.
In navigation the common definition is from North = 0° clockwise, East = 90°, South = 180°, West = 270°, as shown in the diagram on the side.
Astrodienst uses an older system, counting from the South = 0° clockwise, West = 90°, North = 180°, East = 270°. Co-Ruler
Jump to navigationJump to search

Venus - ruling the enclosed Taurus - is here the co-ruler of Twelve[1]
The co-ruler governs the Zodiac Sign that follows the sign of the house cusp in a House.

The characteristics of a house are primarily shaped by the sign that is intercepted and its Ruler; this is initially perceivable and experienceable. Only afterwards does the second sign come into play, along with its ruler.

For example, if the Ascendant is in Taurus, but the sign Gemini begins in the first house, then Venus is the ruler of the Ascendant, and Mercury is the co-ruler.

The co-ruler is particularly significant in the case of intercepted signs.

Not to be confused with Sub-ruler!

Interpretation
The co-ruler or the co-ruling sign is usually felt and experienced in the respective house only through the "indirect" influence of the ruling sign or its ruler. Co-rulers are thus generally considered to be weaker than the actual ruler of a house. Often, the co-ruler, in comparison to the ruler, is only truly experienced and brought to fruition later in life regarding the theme of the respective house. This is less noticeable with signs that are also intercepted by a house apex than with enclosed signs, as in the latter case, the theme of their sign is more strongly lived out in the following house.Angular House

Meaning
The first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses are termed angular houses.

In quadrant house systems their angular house cusps are equal with the axes: the first house, the ascendant; the seventh house, the descendant; the tenth house, the Medium Coeli; and the fourth house, the Imum Coeli.

In an equal house system the MC/IC axis will probably be embedded in the houses. In a whole sign house system, all four angles are normally located within houses.

Interpretation
Planets in angular houses are considered to be a strong influence in the horoscope, particularly so if they are close to an axis.

The angular modality of a house is similar to an element's Cardinal Quality.

Finnish chart, Placidus houses
These are a category of House Systems (also called unequal house systems,) because they normally give rise to houses encompassing varying numbers of degrees; although each house will have the same number of degrees as the house opposite to it (for example, the second and eighth houses). In contrast, a whole sign or Equal house system consistently yields houses of 30 degrees each.

Differences in Calculation
In a quadrant house system, the chart is divided into quarters by the Medium Coeli and Imum Coeli (midheaven or MC and IC) axis and by the Ascendant and Descendant axis. These lines form the cusps of the first, fourth, 7th, and 10th houses. In contrast, in an equal house or whole sign system, MC and IC will normally fall somewhere within their four houses. Examples of popular quadrant house systems are Placidus and Koch for birth charts, and the Regiomontanus system in horary astrology.

Although all house systems in use today involve a projection of a 12-fold division of the cosmos onto the Ecliptic the various quadrant house systems differ in terms of several key concepts important in conceptualizing and dividing the three-dimensional space in which planets, stars, and abstract points move over the course of a day. House systems vary in terms of which reference points are used to bisect the Celestial Sphere and whether the house divisions represent measurements of segments of time or of distance.

For example, one could determine the “up-down” axis of a chart in terms of the highest point of the sun’s daily journey (the MC) and its opposite point (the IC) or as the highest point in the sky (the Zenith) and its opposite point, the Nadir. The ascendant/descendant axis might be calculated as the simple visible horizon positions of the sun at dawn and sunset, or as a projection of the earth’s equator outward onto the celestial sphere, the Celestial Equator. In visualizing the course of the sun from its point of dawn in the east to its highest point in its journey across the sky, one could measure the sun’s course in units of time (hours and minutes) or in units of distance, normally calculated as degrees.


Same person, Equal houses[1]
Advantages and Disadvantages
Today astrologers disagree on which is the “best” house system to use. Proponents of quadrant house systems claim a level of accuracy in timing events which an equal house system, with cusps at 0 degrees or at the same degree of each sign, is unlikely to match.

On the other hand, unequal houses can contain very narrow houses and very wide ones, to the point where an entire sign may be intercepted within house cusps showing the adjacent signs.Some astrologers feel that an Intercepted Sign has no special significance, while others find them to have interpretive value. With very high latitude northern births, unequal houses may appear very skewed, indeed. With an equal house system where the angles appear embedded within houses, however, at high latitudes the MC and IC may also appear nowhere near their respective 1st, 7th, 10th, and 4th houses. With Scandinavian births, for example, it is possible for the MC to appear in the 12th house of a whole sign system.

Some astrologers recommend using different house systems for different individuals. For example, a man born with the sun right on the Cusp between two houses may identify more with one house than other, based upon his life experience. Some quadrant house systems will shift the sun into the house that makes the most sense to this individual. Also, the same astrologer may use a different house system for different types of astrology: for example, Placidus for natal chart interpretation and Regiomontanus for horary astrology.

The most common Hellenistic system of house division is a quadrant division system known today as Porphyry houses, where each quadrant is divided evenly into thirds by degrees on the ecliptic. In the Hellenistic tradition, it is most likely that this quadrant house system was derived from the works of the influential ancient authors Nechepso and Petosiris. (Brennan, p. 370). The whole sign house system, derived from other texts, became the primary form of division, while quadrant systems were often overlaid on top to aid in the application of a specific technique, such as the length of life technique. (Brennan, p. 386-392).

Medieval astrologers continued to utilize these two systems in tandem, but over time, quadrant division systems gained popularity and became the primary method of house division. (Dykes). Other popular quadrant house systems include the Campanus and Koch systems, and the Regiomontanus for horary astrology.

The best method of house division is a topic of frequent debate among modern astrologer Ascendant

The rising sign already tells you a lot about the chart owner
Abbrevation: Asc

Synonym: rising sign

The point of the zodiac rising on the Eastern horizon at any given moment. The term comes from the Latin ascendere (to ascend). The usual abbreviation is Asc, in Europe also AC. The term used for the opposite point is the Descendant.

Astronomy
The Ascendant is the point of intersection between the Eastern horizon and the ecliptic. Due to the rotation of the Earth around its own axis this means that, viewed from any given location, roughly every two hours a different sign of the zodiac ascends on the Eastern horizon. This causes the Ascendant to traverse the whole of the zodiac during the course of a day. Two individuals born at the same time but at a great distance from each other would have different signs on the Ascendant.

Long and short ascension
Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to the ecliptic, the twelve signs do not take the same amount of time to cross the eastern horizon. At the equator, there is very little difference (Pisces, Aries, Virgo and Libra take slightly less time than the other signs), but as one moves from the equator, larger and larger differences emerge.

In the northern hemisphere, the signs of Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus and Gemini take much less time than the theoretical two hours to cross the eastern horizon, whilst the signs of Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius take much longer than two hours to do so. For example, at the latitude of Paris, France:

Pisces and Aries take only one hour to cross the eastern horizon (this is referred to as the length of ascension, or simply as the sign's ascension)
Aquarius and Taurus have an ascension of one hour and fifteen minutes
Capricorn and Gemini have an ascension of one hour and fifty minutes
Cancer and Sagittarius have an ascension of two hours and thirty minutes
Leo and Scorpio have an ascension of two hours and forty minutes
Virgo and Libra have an ascension of two hours and forty-five minutes
At higher latitudes, these differences become even more marked. Astrologers consider the differences between the rate at which the signs ascend to be of importance. In many house systems, houses can become very large when they cover Aquarius, Pisces, Aries and Taurus because these signs are seen to be much smaller from the perspective of a northern hemisphere observer.

Some astrologers consider the preponderance of ascendants in signs from Cancer through Sagittarius (known as the western signs) to be symbolic of the relationship-oriented character inherent in the northern hemisphere and ascendants in the signs from Capricorn through Gemini (known as the eastern signs) to be symbolic of the more individual-oriented character in the southern hemisphere.[1]

In the southern hemisphere, long and short ascension are reversed. For instance, at the latitude of Concepción, Chile:

Pisces and Aries ascend in two hours and thirty minutes
Aquarius and Taurus ascend in two hours and twenty-five minutes
Capricorn and Gemini ascend in two hours and fifteen minutes
Sagittarius and Cancer ascend in two hours
Scorpio and Leo ascend in one hour and thirty-five minutes
Libra and Virgo ascend in one hour and fifteen minutes
Mythology
Liz Greene[2]: The emergence of the Sun each morning seemed to ancient peoples a miraculous enactment of the rebirth of the Sun god, after his travails in the realms beneath the earth. The magical moment of sunrise is thus associated in myth with renewal and freedom from imprisoning darkness, and the earth's eastern horizon is the physical doorway to the future, where hope is born again.

The symbol of the rising Sun promises the opportunity to remake the past, correct old mistakes, find fresh enthusiasm and believe in our dreams once more. "Hope," wrote Alexander Pope, "springs eternal in the human breast." This unquenchable faith in a future which we ourselves can make better is one of our greatest human resources, allowing us to shake off the pain and disappointment of the past.

The Ascendant, in astrological symbolism, is that point on the earth's horizon which lies due east of the place of birth. This eastern point is the embodiment of the rising Sun. Because of the earth's daily rotation on its axis, the circle of the zodiac appears to revolve around us every twenty-four hours, and one of the twelve zodiacal signs will be rising on the eastern horizon according to the date and time of birth. This rising or Ascendant sign colors the doorway through which we, in the same way as the Sun, enter the world. It portrays our basic mode of self-expression each time we encounter any new situation, or whenever we need to assert our identity to the outer world.

Where the Sun in the horoscope reflects our fundamental urge to express ourselves, the Ascendant, the solar doorway on the earthly plane, describes how we make that urge known to others and to our immediate environment.

Interpretation
The Ascendant is a very personal factor in the horoscope. Its position in a particular sign and any planetary aspects to it give it a unique character.

It stands for the individual's start in life and the energies which influenced this particular moment in time. The Ascendant is considered to indicate the direction of the individual's path in life and the soul's intention. In addition it shows how an individual interacts with his surroundings, how he presents himself and how he is perceived by others. The Latin word Persona, meaning mask, is a fitting term - i.e. the face one shows the world.

The German astrologer Denzinger wrote the following about the difference between the Ascendant and the planets:

"It (the Ascendant) is often treated as an appendage to the Sun, as a kind of complementary factor to which we attribute those characteristics we associate with an individual that just doesn't seem to fit with the Sun sign... But one thing is certain: The Ascendant doesn't share many similarities with the Sun, Moon and the other planets. To start with, the cosmic symbolism is completely different. The Sun, Moon and the other planets are physical bodies in dynamic orbit around a common centre... they correspond to particular qualities to which we have access on our life's journey – the Ascendant gives us the spiritual-mental orientation we need when following our chosen path. The difference is similar to that between a vehicle (planet) and a road sign (Ascendant). Although totally different, the road sign can help a vehicle to reach its destination without losing track or making large detours."[3]

The Ascendant is the sign that marks the beginning of the first house which is associated with the zodiac sign of Aries.

Effects of the ascendant
There are a couple of factors that influence how strong or weak a force the ascendant may be in the chart.[4]

It is generally believed that the closer to the beginning of the sign the ascendant falls, the stronger it will be. This is because most of the first house will fall into that sign. If the ascendant falls late in a sign, most of the first house will fall into the following sign and thus weaken the effect of the ascendant's power.
The ascendant is thought to be stronger in influence when the sun is in a weak position in the chart. For example, it is traditionally believed that the sun is in a weaker position when it is placed at the bottom of the chart, near the Imum Coeli or IC. This is because the sun was literally on the other side of the earth when the subject was born, hidden from view.
According to some, the sun may also be weaker in influence if it is unaspected; in other words, if it forms no major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square or sextile) to the other planets. According to other astrological observations, unaspected suns and planets show greater than usual effect and are more free.
The sun in a sign that is intercepted, meaning it does not have a house cusp, may also be weaker and put more emphasis on the ascendant and house cusp of the sun's house in such a chart.
Another factor concerning the effect of the ascendant is the theory that people become more like their sun sign after around 29 years old, as they grow older and more confident, as the sun embodies essential ego energy and self-esteem, and thus perhaps have less of a need to present a public face to others. It is also theorised that when the progressed ascendant moves into the following sign, it weakens the influence of the natal ascendant.

Planets and the ascendant
Planets have added importance in the birth chart due to their relationship to the ascendant.[5] The planet that rules the astrological sign of the ascendant is called the Chart Ruler and is said to be of particular importance. So for example, if the ascendant sign is Gemini, Mercury will be the chart ruler, and so "set the tone" for the chart in many ways. In addition, the planet nearest the ascendant, especially located in the first house, is usually called the rising planet and has a particular significance in the chart. However, if a planet in the twelfth house is very close to (within one or two degrees of) the ascendant, then it can be interpreted as the rising planet instead. If a planet is actually in conjunction with the ascendant (within the same degree as the ascendant), it then becomes vitally important in its effect on the personality, to the extent of being as important as the sun. Finally, any planets in the first house will always have an added emphasis.

Modes of the ascendant
The effect of the ascendant varies according to the modes of the sign in which it is placed.[6] These relate to the quality of the part of the season they occur in.

Ascendant cardinal signs
Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn are cardinal signs. The effect of these signs on the ascendant is to emphasize initiative, assertiveness and to some extent leadership.

Ascendant fixed signs
Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius are fixed signs. The effect of these signs on the ascendant is to emphasize stability, steadiness and commitment.

Ascendant mutable signs
Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces are mutable signs. The effect of these signs on the ascendant is to emphasize adaptability, dexterity, change and flexibility.

Elements of the ascendant (Triplicities)
Ascendant fire signs
The fire signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are noted for their energy, enthusiasm and optimism. When a fire sign is on the ascendant the outer manner is friendly, uncritical and non-hostile. They typically send out friendly but serious and competent signals which draw out a friendly and rather respectful response from others. Aries rising gives out a well-organized, slightly stern bearing. Leo rising subjects have a dignified and rather formal manner which inspires confidence, while Sagittarius risers have a cheerful, pleasant and rather witty outer manner which suits all kinds of situations.

Ascendant earth signs
Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn ascendants are usually considered calm and stress-resistant individuals. The effect of the earth sign ascendant make people more material, reserved and collected, they don't tend to show their emotions and can be or appear to be cold. This particular effect is manifested to the least extent in Taurus sign. Each of the earth signs ascendants are usually thrifty and good with planning things beforehand.

Ascendant air signs
The air signs of Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are noted for their communication skills. When an air sign is on the ascendant the subject is friendly and sociable, but also independent and somewhat detached. The Gemini riser is constantly busy, fully engaged in a kind of juggling act, with at least a dozen activities on the go at any one time. The Libra riser occupies themself with business schemes which often need the aid of a more earthy partner to make them come to fruition. The Aquarius riser makes wonderful plans for themselves or others and may even carry some of them out.

Ascendant water signs
The water signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces are noted for their emotion, intuition and feeling. When a water sign is on the ascendant the subject will hide their true feelings and have a strong need to protect themselves from the world around them. What you see is often not what you get with water ascendants. In other words, the signals they send out are consciously or unconsciously chosen for effect. Cancerians appear chatty and helpful and they do well in any situation that requires tact. Scorpio risers can use many different forms of camouflage with people they do not know, one of their favourites being offensiveness and an off-putting manner. Pisces risers appear soft, gentle, self-sacrificing and sometimes even helpless, but this is misleading, as they will fight strongly for what they think is right. Pisces are also known to be highly emotional and the most intuitive of the twelve signs Angle

Symbol for the Semi-Square
Two types of angles are commonly meant in astrology.

A line drawn from the Medium Coeli and Imum Coeli creates an "up-down" or south-north axis.
A line drawn from the Ascendant to the Descendant creates an east-west axis. The resulting cross as well as each of its four points, are called the chart angles, or cardinal points.

Aspects are also described in terms of angles, such as the square of 90 degrees and the trine of 120 degrees.
The distance between any two points on the horoscope, whether it forms a major aspect or not, is expressed in degrees, termed the angular distance.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect—this is a detailed overview of the astrological framework from the basic signs to the coordinate systems and angles that underpin chart calculation. Let me summarize and integrate it for clarity, with an eye toward practical astrology and chart interpretation:

1. Signs and Elements
12 Zodiac Signs are divided by element and mode:

Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) → energetic, expressive, initiative-driven.

Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) → grounded, practical, stable.

Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) → intellectual, social, communicative.

Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) → emotional, intuitive, sensitive.

Each sign is also Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable, which affects how its energy manifests: initiating, sustaining, or adapting.

2. Houses
Houses define life areas; 12 in total:

1st House (Ascendant): personality, self-expression.

2nd House: values, possessions, self-worth.

3rd House: communication, siblings, environment.

4th House (IC): roots, home, family, emotional foundation.

5th House: creativity, romance, children.

6th House: work, health, routine.

7th House (Descendant): partnerships, relationships.

8th House: shared resources, transformation, metaphysics.

9th House: philosophy, travel, higher education.

10th House (MC): career, public image, vocation.

11th House: friends, community, aspirations.

12th House: subconscious, retreats, hidden matters.

Angular Houses (1, 4, 7, 10) are especially potent, expressing Cardinal energy and significant influence in the chart.

3. House Rulers
Sign ruler of the house cusp governs that house:

Ex: 2nd house cusp in Aries → Mars is ruler, influencing material matters.

Co-rulers (secondary) add subtlety, often felt later in life, especially with intercepted signs.

4. Ascendant / Rising Sign
Point on the eastern horizon at birth; starts the 1st house.

Influences personality, self-expression, and perception by others.

Chart ruler is the planet ruling the ascendant sign; very influential.

Rising planet is the nearest planet to the ascendant; also important.

Mode and element of the ascendant modify behavior:

Cardinal → initiative, leadership

Fixed → stability, determination

Mutable → adaptability, flexibility

Fire → energetic, optimistic

Earth → calm, practical

Air → communicative, detached

Water → intuitive, emotional, protective

5. Aspects
Angular relationships between planets (0–180°) that define interaction:

Conjunction (0°) → merging energies

Opposition (180°) → tension, polarity

Square (90°) → challenge, conflict

Trine (120°) → ease, natural talents

Sextile (60°) → opportunity, harmony

Minor aspects (e.g., semisquare 45°, quincunx 150°) add nuance.

Orbs define allowable deviation for aspects to still be effective.

6. Astrocartography
Projects planetary positions onto a world map to show where energies are most pronounced.

Conjunction with axes (Asc, Desc, MC, IC) marks areas of potential influence.

Primarily secondary to the natal chart; location can emphasize planetary themes but doesn’t override birth chart dynamics.

7. Coordinate Systems for Calculations
Equatorial: celestial latitude = declination, celestial longitude = right ascension.

Ecliptic: aligned with the Sun’s path; ecliptic latitude/longitude.

Horizontal/Azimuth: observer-based; zenith/nadir = vertical axis, azimuth = horizontal angle from north/south reference.

8. Quadrant vs. Equal / Whole Sign Houses
Quadrant systems (Placidus, Koch, Regiomontanus): divide the chart by angles; houses vary in size.

Equal / Whole Sign: 30° per house; easier for intercepted signs.

Choice of house system can affect interpretation, especially for cusp-heavy or high-latitude charts.

9. Angles
Ascendant / Descendant → east-west axis

MC / IC → north-south axis

Aspects can be measured relative to these axes, defining chart geometry and planetary emphasis.

If you want, I can make a single chart “cheat sheet” showing signs, houses, rulers, elements, modes, aspects, and angles all in one visual reference that’s directly usable for natal chart readings. This would compress all this info into a practical tool.

Do you want me to make that cheat sheet?

The four Quadrants
Abbrevation: IC

The Northerly point of Culmination of a sign of the zodiac for a particular time as viewed from a particular location.

The literal translation of Medium Coeli (abbreviation: MC) is "middle of sky". The Imum Coeli lies opposite the Medium Coeli.

Astronomy
The Imum Coeli, the midnight point, represents the lower point of intersection between the Meridian and the Ecliptic. It should not be confused with the Nadir. As is the case with the other Axes, all the signs of the zodiac cross the Imum Coeli in the course of one day.

Interpretaton
As the lowest point in the horoscope, the Imum Coeli symbolises the area of life in which an individual is all alone. It is the place of greatest intimacy but also of greatest vulnerability. Here are the roots of the personality in both the literal (family) and figurative sense (soul) and the archetypal pattern. This is the point at which one can best allow oneself to fall or let go.

In the Hellenistic tradition, the fourth whole sign place was referred to as the subterraneous place, based on the Greek term Hupogeion or Hades, meaning underground, as it was the farthest point in the natal chart below the horizon.

The ideas symbolised by the Imum Coeli often remain unconscious because they have been so familiar to us since early childhood. It stands for the past, in contrast to the Medium Coeli which symbolises the future/ destinationn.

The IC signifies a person’s ancestral roots, home and property, foundation, and parents. As planets located near the IC are the most hidden, the IC may also represent those things that are hidden from the native, and the native’s private life.[1]

The sign of the zodiac on the Imum Coeli indicates an individual's true nature deep down inside and the quality of their innermost needs and feelings.

In Quadrant House Systems the Imum Coeli marks the beginning of the fourth house, and is associated with the Moon as its Natural House Ruler in modern astrology. Intercepted Sign
Jump to navigationJump to search

US President Abraham Lincoln: wide first and seventh houses. Pisces and Virgo are intercepted
A sign of the zodiac in which there are no house cusps. This means - depending on the House System you prefer - that the house is so large that the cusp at the beginning is in the previous sign and the cusp at the end in the following one.

Intercepted signs come in pairs: if one sign is intercepted, its opposite sign will be intercepted, as well. Then the chart will also have "duplicate" signs, where the same sign appears on two house cusps.

Interpretation
The common view is that the energy of an intercepted sign is somehow enclosed or "trapped" - as the graphic portrayal in the horoscope would suggest – making it difficult to develop. The preceeding sign on the cusp of the house is considered to be the house's primary ruler with the intercepted sign the secondary ruler of the house.

In Psychological Astrology it is felt that the intercepted sign shows itself in a more indirect or weakened way.
In Traditional Astrology the intercepted sign's Ruler usually is seen as Co-significator, though.[1] Main Axis
Jump to navigationJump to search

The four quadrants
Ascendant to Descendant (Horizontal Axis), Medium Coeli to Imum Coeli (Vertical Axis). They are usually simply called the axes. The term axis is often used to refer to the axis connecting the Ascendant and the Descendant or the one connecting the Medium Coeli and the Imum Coeli.

Taken together, the axes Ascendant/Descendant and Medium Coeli/Imum Coeli form a cross within the horoscope which divides it into four segments (quadrants). This axial cross (also referred to as the celtic cross) is clearly defined in the horoscope and remains the same irrespective of the house System used.

The Celtic cross places the person within a temporal and spatial perspective. The owner of the horoscope stands symbolically at the point where the two axes intersect, i.e. in the middle of the horoscope. The horizontal axis forms the spatial framework: The Ascendant indicates how we present ourselves to the world and the Descendant how we react to others. The vertical axis shows a temporal perspective: The Imum Coeli equates with the past and describes where we come from and what our roots are, while the Medium Coeli points towards the future and indicates the direction we should take, what our destination is.

Etymology
The Latin verb cadere means "to fall" and Hellenistic astrologers saw these houses as falling away from the angles. The Latin term was originally derived from the Greek word apoklima (ἀπόκλιμα), which means “slope” or “decline”.

Astronomy
The cadent houses are ones in which the planets precede the angular houses in the diurnal rotation, and thus they are declining or falling away from the horoscope Angles..

Interpretation
The angular houses are thought to be the ones in which the planets are goaded into action, and thus the planets are more active and efficacious there, whereas the succeedent houses are rising up towards the angles, and thus the planets are becoming more active and powerful there. Since planets in the cadent houses are declining away from the angles, their power is seen as weakened or waning.

Although cadent houses were supposedly weaker and even misfortunate, this really applies only to the sixth and twelfth houses in traditional astrology.
Modern astrologers are less inclined to see any houses as misfortunate.

The cadent modality of a house is similar to an element's mutable Quality. Succedent House

The Succedent Houses[1]
The second, fifth, eighth and eleventh houses are termed succedent houses.

Etymology
“Succedent” derives from the Latin succedens meaning "subsequent" or "succeeding". The succedent houses follow or succeed the angular houses.

Interpretation
They correspond, respectively, to possessions and values, love and creation, shared possessions and resources, and friends and social concerns.
They use or utilise objects and persons (as a result of the preceeding angular house).

In this way, the second house, for example, which succeeds the first house of the body and personality, tends to signify the things that belong to the person. In a similar fashion, the eighth house, which follows the seventh house of the partner or spouse or “other person,” represents the belongings of the other person or partner.

The succedent modality of a house is similar to an element's Fixed Quality.

See alsoDerived Houses
Jump to navigationJump to search
Derived or "turned" houses are often used in Horary Astrology, but they have wider application for assigning house rulership to complex topics. Turned houses require a basic grasp of the topics ruled by different houses, according to the house numbers. The basic method is to determine which houses are the principal Rulers of the topics in question. Because compound topics apply to two or even more houses, the astrologer first determines which house is most fundamental to the topic. He then counts from that house the same number of houses as the next house number relevant to the topic, which ideally yields information about the matter in question. Essentially the method sets the initial relevant house equal to house number one. The counting starts with that house.

For example, suppose a client asks an astrologer about her husband's money. In a horoscope the husband is represented by the seventh house; and money, by the second house. Beginning with the seventh house as house number one, the astrologer counts two houses, arriving at house number eight in the chart. This method is actually the origin of the eighth house as the "house of shared resources," namely income from the marriage accessed by both spouses.

Derived houses can become more complex. If the client's sister is worried about her son's health, the sister is a third house matter, as it rules siblings. Children are a fifth house matter, so the sister's son (the client's nephew) is also a fifth house concern. The fifth house from the third house is the seventh house. Note that in this particular question, the seventh is no longer the "house of marriage" but the house of the nephew. The sixth house rules health, so to inquire about the nephew's health, we count six more houses, beginning with the seventh, arriving at the twelfth house of the horoscope.

When a derived house count goes past the 12th house, it continues around the chart through the first house. For example, a friend's child begins with the 11th "house of friends." The 5th house from the 11th is the third house, which should yield the desired information. Descendant
Jump to navigationJump to search

The setting sign is where you are looking towards
The point on the zodiac setting on the western horizon at any given time. The term originates from the Latin 'descendere'. The common abbreviation is Desc or DC.

The descendant is opposite the ascendant and is one of the four chart angles.

Interpretation
The descendant marks the beginning or cusp of the Seventh House: the traditional house of marriage, long-term relationships (such as business partners,) and "open enemies".[1] In Horary Astrology the seventh house shows a person about whom a question is asked.

The seventh house relates to the sign of Libra.

In modern western astrology the seventh house is more generally the house of contact with others. It indicates our perception of others, notably in our intimate relationships. Although it is relevant for all kinds of longstanding relationships, intimate ones are usually central in our lives. The descendant also shows how others approach us. The sign on the descendant, together with that sign's planetary ruler, any planets that conjunct it, or planets within the seventh house, indicate how an individual will experience this area of life.

Just as the descendant necessarily complements the ascendant, so the 'You' complements the 'I' to create a whole. However, the result is not a symbolic fusion but experiences that are only possible with the involvement of others.

It is nevertheless symbolically remarkable that relationships and love are to be found at that point where the Sun descends (or falls) in opposition to the ascendant. The German astrologer Ernst Ott writes on this point: "Some of us find it difficult to let our egos take a back seat. In our relationships we try to dominate, assert ourselves or even view love itself as a kind of competitive game. On the other hand, there are those who use their partners to bolster their lack of self confidence... But without a healthy ego (ascendant) there can't be true equality within a relationship (descendant). Both the inflated ego and conforming to the wishes of others due to lack of self-confidence meet their fall."[2]

The sign on the descendant and its ruling planet suggest the type of partner or spouse to whom the individual is attracted. Because it is always opposite the ascendant, or "me" point on the chart, people oftentimes hope for a lover who will make up for desired qualities they lack. [3]

The descendant can also serve as an individual's window of projection. In that case the descendant stands for inherent traits which the person does not actively experience and manifest, and therefore seeks out or attracts in others. Perhaps the person is unaware of these traits, or perhaps the traits are unacceptable to him because they conflict with his moral ideals. Quadrant

The four quadrants of a horoscope[1]
Each horoscope can be easily divided into four parts. In an Equal house system grouping the houses 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 divides the chart into four euqal quarters. In Quadrant House Systems divided by the Ascendant/Descendant (AC/DC) and Medium Coeli/Imum Coeli (MC/IC) axes quadrants usually differ in size, their exact size depending on the place and time of birth. In Central Europe(around 50 degrees north latitude), the quadrants are the same size when the Ascendant is in the second half of Virgo or first half of Libra and in the opposing signs of Pisces and Aries.

In a natal chart reading, each quadrant has a different quality which arises from the division of the horoscope by the two main axes. Over the centuries, astrologers devised different interpretations of quadrant meanings, but they generally follow a logic based upon the meanings of the chart Angles. The AC/DC axis, for example, gives an above- and below-ground division, enabling the astrologer to distinguish a day birth from a night birth, depending upon the sun's hemisphere. East of the MC/IC axis planets are oriental, and are in a condition of rising towards their highest point in the sky. West of the line planets are western or occidental, and descend towards their lowest point in the horoscope.

Because different astrologers number the quadrants differently, it may be easiest to conceptualize them as "upper" vs. "lower" and "east" vs. "west" to minimize confusion.

Using the symbolism of the sun through the quadrants, traditional astrologers determined that the upper hemisphere indicated visible, public expression; whereas the lower hemisphere showed more private, hidden matters. East indicated active beginnings and initiative. The West showed, if not a state of decline, traits that were more passive and adaptable.

The top of a horoscope also indicates the direction south; and the bottom of the horoscope, north. Consequently, in putting together the compound meanings of the quadrants, traditional astrologers determined that the southeast quadrant, for example, was hot, moist, active, masculine, and symbolic of infancy.

Modern astrologers take different meanings from the nature of the chart angles. Due to its relation to the first house, the eastern Hemisphere of the horoscope is the personal hemisphere, whereas the western Hemisphere is the Relationship hemisphere in relation to the DS as the cusp of the 7th house. The top hemisphere, or "diurnal hemisphere", represents the individual's outer world, the bottom Hemisphere, or "nocturnal hemisphere", his inner world. Combining these meanings gives: the north- or lower east quadrant stands for the personal interior world; the lower west for the relationship interior; the upper west, for the relationship outer; and the upper east, one's personal exterior world.

The lower east quadrant represents themes which the self seeks to express directly. These themes are particularly apparent and cannot (or only with great effort) be suppressed. This quadrant is the most apparent to the outside world. The planetary energies in this quadrant actively shape the personality.

The lower west quadrant is about contact with others on an inner emotional level. This segment is therefore often described as the "soul quadrant". It represents themes and individual wishes to share with others in order to promote inner development.

The upper west quadrant is about direct contact with the outer world. It shows the kind of expectations a person has for relationships and how these can be realised in difficult times. It also stands for official contacts with others in society such as contracts. The third quadrant also expresses what has been learnt and integrated in the first two quadrants.


View of the Munich Rhythm Method
In the upper east quadrant, personal themes are expressed with the intention of influencing the public sphere. This quadrant goes beyond the development of personal potential as in the first quadrant. Personal insight is translated into the wish to influence the wider society. The fourth quadrant symbolises themes of a collective nature as opposed to the subjective qualities of the first quadrant. In order to be able to do this, the challenges of the first quadrant must first of all be met, otherwise the tasks faced in the fourth quadrant will remain unclear and ambiguous.

Because many people will have an emphasis on one quadrant in their charts, the quadrants suggest their principal orientation to life. An absence of planets in a quadrant may show that it is not a particular focus for them. House

Depiction of a horoscope, showing the different significations of each Mundane House[1]
The horoscope is divided into twelve segments called the astrological houses and - depending on which house system is used - can be of equal or unequal size. The twelve houses could be thought of as a disk which is superimposed on the twelve signs of the zodiac in various combinations. The houses are, like the signs of the zodiac, numbered from one to twelve in an anti- clockwise direction.

There is an analogous relationship between the houses and the signs of the zodiac: The first house is analogous with the sign of Aries, the second with Taurus and so on. Likewise, the ruler of the analogous sign of the zodiac is also the natural ruler of the house, for example Mars is the ruler of the first house, Venus of the second and so on.

The planets describe innate forces and the signs characteristics, whereas the houses represent the particular areas of life where these find expression. The houses are "earthly" as opposed to the "celestial" signs of the zodiac and planets. They are concerned with acting on and expressing the "celestial" forces within. For this reason, the themes of the houses are relatively insignificant in the horoscopes of children and instead are revealed over time.

The first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses are referred to as the cardinal houses (Quality). Planets in cardinal houses, at least when they are situated in the first half, are often considered to be dominant. Each house is associated with a particular area of life (more detailed information can be found under the headings "First House", "Second House" and so on). The following classification remains essentially the same, irrespective of the house system used:

First house: appearance, beginnings
Second house: values, substance, talents
Third house: immediate surroundings, communication, learning
Fourth house: family, roots, emotional inheritance
Fifth house: creative self-expression, children, fun
Sixth house: health, work
Seventh house: contacts, relationships
Eighth house: transformation, letting go, partaking in the whole
Ninth house: search for meaning, longer journeys, world-view
Tenth house: vocation, aims in life
Eleventh house: friends, groups
Twelfth house: withdrawal, transcendence, spirituality
The next table represents the basic outline of the houses as they are still understood today and includes the traditional Latin names. The houses are numbered from the east downward under the horizon, each representing a specific area of life. Many modern astrologers assume that the houses relate to their corresponding signs,[2][3] i.e. that the first house has a natural affinity with the first sign, Aries, and so on.[4]

The house cusp marks the beginning of a house. The sign of the zodiac in which this falls, and any sign that is completely enclosed within the house (i.e. is not cut by any house cusp), indicate how an individual approaches this particular area of life. Planets in the house indicate which forces are expressed there.

The division into houses is connected to the Earth's rotation. It depends on the location at which an event occurs (birth) and the time. At any particular place the Ascendant (and therefore all the houses) moves through the whole zodiac. The division into houses is the most individual factor in the horoscope - even more so than the Moon which moves roughly one degree every two hours. When two people are born within half an hour of each other at the same place, the Ascendant has already moved 7 1/2 degrees (on average 1 degree every 4 minutes) and could easily have moved on to the next sign of the zodiac. This means that certain planets may also have changed house position during this time. Because the planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto spend years in one sign of the zodiac, their house positions are actually far more significant than the signs they are in.

Whoa, you just dumped a full astrology encyclopedia in one go! 😅 Let’s break it down and make it digestible, because there’s a lot to unpack here—ICs, axes, quadrants, cadent/succedent houses, intercepted signs, and derived houses. I’ll give you the key insights and how it all interconnects.

1. Imum Coeli (IC)
Opposite the Medium Coeli (MC), aka the top of your chart.

Literally: “bottom of the sky,” representing your roots, home, private life, ancestry, and early foundations.

Symbolically: where you’re most vulnerable, intimate, and alone.

Planets near IC are hidden or private, revealing the deepest part of your psyche.

Houses: Marks the start of 4th house, traditionally ruled by Moon.

Bottom line: IC = your inner world, family, early life, and deepest emotional bedrock.

2. Descendant (DC)
Opposite the Ascendant (AC).

Marks 7th house, the house of partnerships and relationships.

Shows what we project onto others, the kind of partner we attract, and our relational dynamics.

Complement to Ascendant: your “I” meets your “You.”

Bottom line: DC = how you relate to others and the qualities you seek in a partner.

3. Quadrants
The chart is divided into 4 quadrants using the axes: AC/DC (horizontal) and MC/IC (vertical).

Each quadrant shows how planetary energies manifest in relation to self, relationships, inner vs. outer life:

Lower East (1st quadrant) – personal, inner world you actively express.

Lower West (2nd quadrant) – relational, inner emotional connections (“soul quadrant”).

Upper West (3rd quadrant) – outer world relationships, contracts, public partnerships.

Upper East (4th quadrant) – personal outer world, influence on society, broader impact.

Bottom line: Quadrants = lens of focus; tells whether life emphasis is personal, relational, public, or private.

4. House Types
Angular (1,4,7,10): Strong, active, dominant houses; planets here are powerful.

Succedent (2,5,8,11): Stable, building upon angular houses; planets support or stabilize energy.

Cadent (3,6,9,12): Weaker, reflective, learning; planets here are more passive.

Derived Houses: Counting from one house to another to see extended influence (like asking about a spouse’s money via 7th → 2nd → 8th house).

5. Intercepted Signs
A sign fully “trapped” inside a house, not touching the cusp.

Usually indicates hidden or difficult-to-develop energy.

Opposite signs are also intercepted.

In modern psych astrology: these energies manifest indirectly or subtly.

6. Putting it Together
IC/MC axis: personal foundation vs. destiny/public life.

AC/DC axis: self vs. relationships.

Quadrants: where your chart emphasizes inner vs. outer life and personal vs. relational matters.

House type & interceptions: how easy or hard energies express themselves.

Basically, the chart is a map of the self, showing the inner roots, outer life, relationships, and how energies flow or get blocked.

If you want, I can draw a quick visual “map” of all these axes, quadrants, and house types so it’s easy to see in one glance—like a cheat sheet for IC/MC, AC/DC, quadrants, and angular/succedent/cadent houses.

The House Axes[1]
House axes are special Axis in the horoscope that connect opposite houses and place them under a common theme:

House One - Seven = I/You Axis, sometimes also called Encounter or Relationship Axis
House Two - Eight = Substance or Value Axis; Holding on and Letting Go
House Three - Nine = Communication, Knowledge, Education, Thought, and Travel Axis
House Four - Ten = Individuation or Growth Axis; Parent and Script[2] Axis
House Five - Eleven = Creativity or Luck Axis
House Six - Twelve = Existence, Crisis, and Transcendence Axis
Note: The houses are interpreted somewhat differently depending on the school!

The position of the intermediate houses (2, 3, 5, 6, as well as opposite 8, 9, 11, 12) also plays a role depending on the House System used.

Here Mars, the Ruler of Aries (where the cusp is located), is the twelfth house's primary ruler[1]
The houses and signs of the zodiac both run in an anticlockwise direction around the horoscope. The house cusp is the line defining the end of one house and the beginning of the next. For example, the Ascendant is the cusp at the beginning of the first and the Descendant the cusp of the seventh, the Medium Coeli the cusp of the tenth house and the Imum Coeli the cusp of the fourth.

Interpretation
A planet's influence is said to increase if it is close to a house cusp. Planets located just before the cusp of the following house are often counted as being in the house that begins with that cusp. The general rule is that planets situated either in the last sixth of a house or within 5 degrees of the cusp are counted to the next house.
This is not necessarily the case with retrograde planets which are moving away from the cusp. Western Hemisphere

Interpretation
If there is a strong emphasis on this side of the horoscope, i.e. when the majority of Planets are placed between the fourth and the ninth house, then the individual has a strong urge to relate to others – in contrast to someone who has a majority of planets in the left side (Eastern Hemisphere) of the horoscope. Eastern Hemisphere

The four quadrants
In a standard chart drawing the eastern hemisphere is the side to the left of the Medium Coeli/Imum Coeli axis. The axis divides the horoscope into two hemispheres.

The eastern hemisphere consists of houses one to three and ten to twelve - or in other words, the first and fourth quadrants. The Ascendant marks its central point.

It is also known as the personal half of the horoscope - as opposed to the western hemisphere of the horoscope (second and third quadrants) which is known as the impersonal half of the horoscope. Vertical Axis

The four quadrants
The vertical axis in a chart runs from the Medium Coeli to the Imum Coeli and divides the chart into two halves: the Eastern Hemisphere (Quadrants I, IV) and the Western Hemisphere (Quadrants II, III).

It places an individual's temporal perspective:
The Imum Coeli equates to the past and family, the Medium Coeli to the future and the goals in life.

Its counterpart is the Diurnal Hemisphere of the horoscope.

Interpretaton
The nocturnal hemisphere is considered to be the more introverted hemisphere of the horoscope.
Signs and Planets in this hemisphere reveal an individual's more inner or unconscious qualities. Energy
Jump to navigationJump to search
The various cosmic energies that, although not concretely manifest, can be perceived on Earth. The word comes from the Greek 'energeia', or activity. Astrologers often talk of energies in connection with astrology. For example, the American astrologer Stephen Arroyo describes astrology as the language of energy.

According to this idea, the three qualities cardinal, fixed and mutable express different patterns of energy.

The energy of the cardinal signs Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn is centrifugal in nature.
The energy of the fixed signs Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius is centripetal.
The mutable signs of Gemini, Virgo,Sagittarius and Pisces have an energy which is spiral-like.
Arroyo calls the planets energy regulators and writes "the planets characterise the way energy is exchanged between individuals and the potential inherent in the universe." Art of Combination

Combing several Horoscope Factors is not simple
The assessment of the various horoscope factors and their interrelations, in other words, the process of horoscope interpretation. The most important maxim is that the total is always greater than the sum of its parts.

The first step is to consider the relationship between following factors:

Planets and Signs of the zodiac,
Planets and Houses,
Planets in Aspect to each other or to one of the Axes,
In the case of the slower moving planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, the house position is considered to be more important than the sign because it is the more individual of the two factors. Many people - not only those born in the same year but in some cases a whole generation - have these planets in the same sign of the zodiac. Their aspects and house positions therefore reveal more about their individual colouring.

A further step is then

A compilation of recurring Themes
The Astrological Alphabet (of Zipporah Dobyns) can be a source of help in this respect. For example, Mars in the tenth house (= Mars-Saturn) and Saturn in Aries (= Saturn-Mars) both express related themes. If a variety of different horoscope factors express a similar theme, its influence will be strengthened. Competing themes may end up moderating or to a certain extent canceling each other out.

A deeper penetration into the inner workings of the horoscope is possible by working with the rulers.

These can either be house rulers or sign rulers. By taking into account the rulers, it is possible to uncover connections between houses, planets and signs as well as between individual planets.

The art of combination begins with small steps - even the simple observation that the Sun is in Gemini is one step in the process of assessing the multitude of horoscope factors and the relationships between them. This process, which is initially often confusing and daunting, becomes easier with practice and is essential for being able to assess the importance of factors both on their own and in combination with others.

The art of combination requires both a logical method and intuition. For example, when interpreting an aspect pattern the aspects must be calculated but the pattern itself is understood intuitively. Interpretation

Combing several Horoscope Factors is not easy
Interpretation is central to astrology. The horoscope, or to be more precise the chart drawing, is simply the symbolic representation of the planets at a particular point in time which then needs to be interpreted. Each astrological symbol is multifaceted and can be interpreted on various levels, and the interplay of the various horoscope factors further multiplies the number of possibilities. For a successful interpretation an astrologer should possess the following:

Astrological knowledge; he or she must understand the meaning of astrological symbols and their various concrete manifestations.
Intuition; is important when attempting to comprehend how the various horoscope factors interact with each other as a whole and enables the astrologer to find images and symbols for these factors.
The ability to make sense of apparently contradictory elements which are often present in horoscopes.
A horoscope's complex nature makes a holistic interpretation necessary. This means that each individual constellation needs to be assessed in relation to the whole chart. Other factors may either emphasise or moderate its influence. But this is not the only reason why one should be wary of relying too heavily on the standard interpretations given in many so-called astrological 'recipe books'. Although they do offer some useful suggestions they can only hint at the full complexity of the nature of each astrological symbol.

An important part of interpretation is being able to pinpoint dominant themes.

Interpretation is an artistic undertaking which evades exact statistical analysis. Intuition
Jump to navigationJump to search

The god Neptune was typically depicted with a trident[1]
The instinctive grasp of themes, opportunities and difficulties reflected within the horoscope without reflection or resorting to any so-called astrological recipe books. The term comes from the Latin 'intueri' (to look at, contemplate). Intuition is the second most important prerequisite next to astrological knowledge required for horoscope interpretation.

Psychology
There are differing opinions on whether intuition is something that can be learnt. It is, however, beyond dispute that it cannot be achieved by practice alone, but if it is present it needs to be continually practised and expanded. Equally beyond dispute is the view that without astrological knowledge, it is inadequate for horoscope interpretation.

Images are an important element of intuition. The intuitive understanding of a particular relation is often communicated through images which then need to be translated into a form - not necessarily language - that is generally understood.


The sign of Aquarius[2]
Astrology
From an astrological point of view, intuition is associated with the planets Uranus, Neptune, the signs of Aquarius and Pisces, together with the eleventh and twelfth houses.
The Uranian aspect is a quick, non-reflective analogous grasp of connections and main themes.
The Neptunian aspect is the deep perception of what lies beyond outward appearances. The astrologer Bernd A. Mertz also calls the Neptunian energy inspiration.
When these factors are especially prominent in the horoscope, or activated by triggers, for example a planetary transit, there is a potential for intuitive development.
Intuition also plays an important role in mysticism which is associated with Neptune, Pisces and the twelfth house.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, now we’re getting into house axes, hemispheres, and the dynamics of interpretation—this builds on what we discussed about IC/MC, AC/DC, quadrants, and house types. Let’s simplify it and connect all the pieces:

1. House Axes
Each axis connects opposite houses, showing a shared theme, like a “tug-of-war” or complementary energy:

Axis	Houses	Theme	I/You Split
I/You Axis	1–7	Self vs. relationships	1 = self, 7 = how you meet/relate to others
Substance/Value	2–8	Holding on vs letting go, resources	2 = your possessions, 8 = partner’s/other’s resources
Knowledge/Travel	3–9	Communication, learning, worldview	3 = learned thought, 9 = your beliefs/worldview
Individual/Backbone	4–10	Roots vs life goals	4 = roots/family, 10 = profession/goal
Creativity/Relationship	5–11	Romance, luck, social connections	5 = personal creativity/love, 11 = group/spiritual aspirations
Existence/Crisis	6–12	Work, daily life vs inner development	6 = service, work, analysis, 12 = inner growth, psychosomatic, unconscious
Takeaway: Axes help you see where life balances between self and others, inner and outer, receiving and giving.

2. House Cusps
Cusp = beginning of a house.

Planets near the cusp have stronger influence in that house.

Rule of thumb: planets within ~5° of a cusp are counted in the next house.

Key cusps: Ascendant (1st), Descendant (7th), MC (10th), IC (4th).

3. Hemispheres
The chart is split into vertical (MC/IC) and horizontal (AC/DC) axes, creating two perspectives:

Hemisphere	Houses	Focus	Central Point
Eastern	1–3, 10–12	Personal, initiative, self-expression	Ascendant
Western	4–9	Impersonal, relationships, outer focus	Descendant
Diurnal (upper)	7–12	Public, conscious, extroverted	MC
Nocturnal (lower)	1–6	Private, introverted, inner life	IC
Bottom line: Upper = conscious, public; Lower = unconscious, private.
East = personal action/initiative; West = relational/passive engagement.

4. Energy & Planetary Patterns
Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) = initiating/centrifugal energy.

Fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) = stabilizing/centripetal energy.

Mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) = adaptive/spiral energy.

Planets regulate energy flow; houses show where energy manifests, signs show how.

5. Art of Combination
A chart isn’t just “planets in houses or signs”; it’s the sum of relationships:

Planets ↔ signs

Planets ↔ houses

Planets ↔ other planets/aspects/axes

Consider themes: recurring planetary patterns amplify influence.

Use rulers (house or sign rulers) to connect planets, signs, and houses.

Interpretation = mix of logic + intuition.

Intuition tip: Neptune, Uranus, Pisces, Aquarius, 11th/12th houses = heightened intuitive grasp of chart energies.

✅ Summary:

Think of your chart as a 3D map of self:

Axes = major life balances (self vs other, past vs future, etc.)

Houses = life arenas where energies play out

Cusps & hemispheres = highlight where planetary energies are strongest and most conscious

Energy modalities = how the action flows

Combination & intuition = the key to seeing the “whole picture”

If you want, I can draw a compact visual showing axes, hemispheres, quadrants, and energy flows—basically a full map of how your chart structure works at a glance. It makes all this easier to digest than walls of text.

Level of Maturity
Jump to navigationJump to search
Inherent within every every planetary placement and horoscope is a wide range of possible expressions, from problematic or even destructive forms to forms which express a high degree of self-reflection and maturity. It is not possible to ascertain how an individual will experience the different aspects within a horoscope just by looking at it, although certain factors tend to pose - at least initially - more problems than others.

Whether or not an individual reflects on the more difficult aspects and tries to find more positive ways to live them remains a matter of free will. Finding ways to give mature expression to inherent qualities is an ongoing process throughout life.

The best way to approach a particular astrological theme is to describe it in a neutral way before considering any potential positive or negative forms of expression.

The following overview gives some positive, negative and neutral examples of how the twelve signs of the zodiac might be expressed.

Sign	Negative Pole	Neutral	Positive Pole
Aries	Aggressiveness	Activity	Initiative
Taurus	Stubbornness	Practicality	Loyalty
Gemini	Dissipation	Open-mindedness	Versatility
Cancer	Cloying	Emotional ties	Warmth and security
Leo	Self-aggrandisement	Self-expression	Generosity
Virgo	Pedantry	Attention to detail	Love of detail
Libra	Kitsch	Aesthetics	Beauty
Scorpio	Being driven	Depth	Instinctual certainty
Sagittarius	Pomposity	Expansion	Grandeur
Capricorn	Miserliness	Economy	Concentrating on the essential
Aquarius	Aloofness	Detachment	Farsightedness / overview
Pisces	Chaos	Dissolving of barriers	Total unity Key Words
Jump to navigationJump to search
Modern astrology textbook authors often use individual words or short phrases as a teaching device, to convey at a glance the essential nature of the various horoscope factors. There is no codified set of "key words" between different authors, but most of them share a common sense of meaning in terms of particular personality traits. One of the British founders of modern astrology, Alan Leo, promoted this practice in his popular primer, How to Judge a Nativity.[1] In matching up signs with house cusp possibilities, for example, he deemed Aries on the cusp of the third house to be, "Acute, selfish, intellectual, impulsive, ambitious, and aspiring." Another popular use of keywords in spiritual astrology is to assign a state of being to each sign. For example, Taurus is "I have", Sagittarius is "I believe," and Pisces is "I perceive."[2]

The use of key words to teach astrology can be traced back to the works of Hellenistic astrologers but in addition to listing personality traits, they often wrote in terms of the signs' elements and qualities and whether planets were hot or cold, moist or dry, leaving the reader to determine how these affected the individual.

Jump to navigationJump to search Axis
Jump to navigationJump to search
The axes of the horoscope refer to both the Horizontal Axis between the Ascendant and Descendant and the vertical one connecting the Midheaven (or Medium Coeli) with the Imum Coeli. They are also referred to as the main axes of the horoscope.

Each axis divides the horoscope into two parts: the horizontal axis divides it into the diurnal hemisphere (above) and the nocturnal hemisphere (below), the vertical axis into the Eastern Hemisphere (according to astrological tradition the left-hand side of the chart) and the Western Hemisphere (the right-hand side). Together, these two axes form a grand cross and divide the horoscope into four quadrants. These main axes remain identical irrespective of the house system being used – the only changes made are to the position of the other houses house cusps.

The term axis is often used to refer to only the Ascendant, Descendant, Medium Coeli or Imum Coeli without reference to the opposite end of the axis.

But the important characteristic of any axis is that it always connects two opposing points, as in the case of the Moon's Nodal Axis Moon's Nodes. In addition, any two houses situated in opposition are considered to create an axis: for example, the axis formed by the first and seventh houses is referred to as the I/You Axis, the second and eighth as the axis of substance, the third and ninth as the axis of communication, the fourth and tenth as the parental and vocational axis, five and eleven as the axis of creativity, and finally the sixth and twelfth as the axis of existence and transcendence  Axis cross

The four horoscope quadrants
The two Axes Horizontal Axis and Vertical Axis form a cross or divide a horoscope into four Quadrants. The Axis Cross is always clearly defined in a horoscope and remains the same, regardless of the chosen House System[1].

It places the individual in a spatial and temporal perspective. The horoscope owner symbolically stands at the intersection of the two axes, in the center. The Horizontal Axis represents him more in his spatial context: the Ascendant symbolizes how he presents himself to the world, while the Descendant indicates how others approach him. The Vertical Axis, on the other hand, shows him more in his temporal perspective: the Imum Coeli corresponds to his past and describes where he comes from and what his roots are, while the Medium Coeli (or the fourth quadrant) represents the future, his destiny and purpose, or describes where he is headed, what his goal is.

The two axes and, with them, the four quadrants are inherently opposing and necessarily contradict each other. Philosophically speaking, in an esoteric sense, this is the "Cross of Incarnation," into which every person is stretched and to which everyone is subjected. The two axes form a cross of fundamental opposites, into which the individual is ontologically ([2]) stretched.

The points of the Axis Cross are considered the strongest sensitive points.

Gertrud Hürlimann: Friedrich Schwab places the fate of man on a coordinate system. "One can symbolically find this relationship in the movement of the Earth. In the rotation from west to east, one could recognize the spatial line, while in the 'resting' Earth's axis, one could recognize the time line." The horizontal represents space, the vertical represents time. 
Moonlight refracted through the atmosphere cast a halo or orb effect as a "ring around the moon"
The margin of deviation or inexactness allowed for an aspect to remain valid. For example, for two planets to be in opposition they do not have to be separated by exactly 180 degrees: the aspect is still valid if the angle is 175 degrees or 185 degrees. A platic aspect is one which has a wide orb but is still considered significant enough to include in a horoscope interpretation.

The concept of orbs comes from the idea that planets cast a certain amount of light or a halo into the sky; such that another planet that is a few degrees away from an exact or partile aspect will still be under its influence. A planet will cast an orb on either side of it. In modern astrology, an orb of 10 degrees for the sun would capture an aspect within a 20-degree arc. A half-arc, cast either to the left or the right of a planet, is a moeity, and if a traditional astrologer cites an orb of 15 degrees for the sun, she would probably use the moity of 7.5 degrees in determining its aspects.

Determining the size of the orb used is a matter of interpretation: Psychological Astrology tends to use larger orbs, whereas Horary Astrology tends to work with tighter ones. The orb in a separating aspect in horary astrology would often not be considered in a judgment, because it symbolizes a matter that is "over and finished", regardless of how narrow the orb is. Astrologers use different rules to determine how wide an orb to use, so one’s own experience is probably the best guide.

In general, modern astrologers allow larger orbs for the sun and moon, of perhaps 10-12 degrees on either side; with narrower orbs for the other planets, perhaps 5-7 degrees. The type of aspect also plays a role in deciding the size of its orb: larger orbs are used for the major aspects such as the conjunction and opposition, whereas smaller orbs are used for the minor aspects (generally 1 to 3 degrees).

Some astrologers will ignore an aspect if the planets are out-of-sign or dissociate even though the orb may be very close. For example, the moon at 29 degrees Aries and the sun at 2 degrees Scorpio are opposed with only a 3-degree orb, well within their normal range; but because the signs are not opposite one another in the horoscope, traditional and horary astrologers would probably discount it.

Description
Sun sign astrology is based on the fact that only a person's so-called "star sign" is known: that is, the Zodiac Sign in which the Sun was located at the time of birth. Sometimes, the Decan of the sign is also taken into account. Basic character traits are assigned to the Sun sign. Furthermore, most predictions published in newspaper horoscopes are based on Transits to the Sun signs.

Transit analysis must necessarily be very imprecise, as the exact position of the Sun in the respective Zodiac sign is either not known at all or only known to within 10 degrees, if differentiated by decans. This mainly considers sign aspects. If Planets are in a harmonious Zodiac Sign related to the respective Sun sign, the connection is considered favorable; if it is in a tense relationship, it is considered unfavorable. Peregrine aspects are often not taken into account.

Mundane Aspects are also considered. If such an aspect is exact, it is assumed that it influences all Sun signs more or less, depending on the sign position of the involved planets in relation to the respective Sun sign. Since not every day sees any exact strong Major Aspects, Minor Aspects such as Semi-Square, Sesqui-Square, Semi-Sextile, Quincunx, or even Quintile are often considered. However, since such aspects— as the name Minor Aspect suggests— are often comparatively subordinate in their effect, if they are not in close resonance with the natal chart, such statements are on shaky ground.

To allow for further individualization and thus different statements for each Sun sign, mundane houses are determined, starting from the Sun sign as the First House, comparable to the "Heavenly Houses" of the Zodiac, where Aries, for example, is also counted as the first heavenly house. If the Sun is in Capricorn, for instance, this sign is also seen as the first Sun house, and from there, the subsequent Zodiac signs are treated as the following houses. Whether the Sun is at the beginning or end of a sign is usually not taken into account.

Purely mundane events are also evaluated, particularly Void of Course Moon, New Moon, and Full Moon, as well as the beginning and end of Retrograde Motion.

Linda Goodman's Sun Signs
Several points make sun sign astrology questionable for Predictive Astrology (Transit analysis):

The constellations related to a sun sign, as the name suggests, always concern an entire sign, but do not consider the exact position of the natal Sun of the person. Thus, the orbs for the Constellations are often quite wide, in extreme cases nearly a whole Zodiac sign, almost 30°! It is easy to see that the effect of such an aspect will hardly be felt. Thus, only a small part of those affected will experience the predicted effect. The decan, that is, the subdivision of those born within a sun sign into three temporally staggered groups, tries to account for this but remains imprecise.

Secondly, it should be noted that transits are more likely to be experienced in relation to the ascendant houses, that is, the known houses of the horoscope, than in relation to the mundane Sun houses. Therefore, when statements are made about which life areas are expected to have effects, these influences can be individually overlaid by the ascendant houses and thus address entirely different life areas than those predicted, for example, instead of partnership (7th House) the profession (10th House).

Another point of criticism is that, of course, only one factor of all horoscope factors is considered, namely the natal Sun in a specific Zodiac sign. All other radix factors must necessarily be disregarded. However, many astrological influences do not concern the natal Sun at all, but one of the other planets or horizon and Meridian Axis. Thus, statements regarding the Sun's position often become obsolete, especially when other transits to factors of the natal chart are stronger in influence. Statements of sun sign astrology then become simply incorrect, as they describe energies that are too weak to be perceived by the individual.

Since sun sign astrology is the basis for horoscopes in daily newspapers and other media, there is competition for the reader's attention. However, since sensationally effective astrological constellations do not occur every day, even the tiniest possible effects, such as those from minor aspects, are greatly exaggerated and elevated to special significance. Expectations are thus often disappointed when they are artificially inflated.

It is often noted that the statements of sun sign astrology do indeed often hold true, albeit only in a very small percentage, but often with astonishing accuracy. In addition to the Barnum Effect, it is likely that the fact plays a role that an evaluated constellation is indeed in an exact aspect to the natal Sun of the individual, and no other astrological constellations concerning the natal chart stand in opposition.

If sun sign astrology is not applied as trivial astrology but based on the exact position of the natal Sun, yet still uses the mundane Sun sign houses, often helpful and meaningful statements can be made, as the houses determined from one's own Sun sign do indeed have significance and are often experienced as accurate for describing the respective life area. However, the effect is to be seen as subordinate to that of the ascendant houses.


Porta - Leo[2]
Natal Astrology
Since the position of the radix Sun in the Zodiac sign is evaluated here, surprisingly accurate statements often result, which, however, quickly slip into typifications, especially when the characteristics of the Zodiac signs are strongly exaggerated. For example, a person with the Sun in Sagittarius is a "typical Sagittarius." In this case, as with transit analysis, other factors that overshadow the Sun sign must necessarily be disregarded. Although the statements regarding the natal Sun are usually accurate, they are greatly overvalued in their significance, and all people are categorized into the same twelve categories of "star signs," which leads to a strong generalization.

Assessment
Sun sign astrology is largely responsible for the poor reputation of astrology for the reasons mentioned above, providing Astrology Opponents with ample fodder for their criticism. Since sun sign astrology is the branch of astrology known to the general public, serious astrology is often lumped together with it. While the desire to make astrological statements based on limited information (Sun sign) is understandable, it often does more harm than good to astrology as a whole regarding its seriousness, especially when more is read into it than is truly present. Nevertheless, it continues to enjoy great popularity in trivial astrology.
The psychological astrologer Liz Greene notes, however, that many astrologers believe that sun sign astrology is, at best, foolish, and at worst, dangerous. However, sun sign astrology can be a legitimate entry point for initial astrology contacts. The characterizations are sometimes absurdly superficial, although this is less due to sun sign astrology itself and more to the clueless newspaper journalists. Nevertheless, even in those cases, there is still an archetypal core of personality contained, which is otherwise significant for the Sun as the most important horoscope planet in the respective signs, regardless of the level of realization[3] Sun

Astronomy
The sun is the star at the centre of our solar system. It has a diameter of 1392 million km and its average distance from the earth is 149 597 870 km. Against the backdrop of the 360 degree circle of the zodiac it has a diameter of around 32 degrees of arc, or half a degree (similar to the Moon). Its average Diurnal Movement is 59.1 minutes of arc.

The sun is a ball of glowing gas and is the source of the earth's light, warmth, and life itself. The earth and the other planets are held in their orbits by its gravitational pull.

Astrologically (in a chart), neither the sun nor the moon can move retrograde - from the earth's perspective. Although neither is a planet in an astronomical sense, both are classified as planets to astrologers. They are also called the luminaries.

Mythology
Liz Greene[1]: The Sun is portrayed in every ancient mythology as the giver of life. Because of its obvious connection with the changing seasons and the sowing and harvesting of crops, the mythic sun gods mated with the earth and fertilized it in a great annual cycle.

In Egypt the solar deity was called Ra, who rose out of the primal chaos of the Nile flood and from his own phallic life-force generated all the other gods. In Babylon the great solar disc of the god Shamash mounted the sky in a chariot each morning, and each evening descended into the depths of the earth.

Most complex of the sun gods is the shining and enigmatic figure of the Greco-Roman Apollo. This highly sophisticated deity can teach us a good deal about the psychological meaning of the Sun in astrological symbolism. Slayer of the earth-snake Python and breaker of family curses, Apollo symbolizes the power of consciousness to free us from our bondage to deep-rooted and destructive complexes from the past.

Called Apollo Longsight because of his power to prophesy, the god also embodies the human gift of foresight, which enables us to see the future consequences of our own actions. As the giver of knowledge he is an image of the civilizing power of human understanding, and as patron of the arts he reflects our capacity to endow our creative efforts with light and life.

The sun was the supreme planetary god in many ancient civilisations such as Egypt, Babylon, Persia, and the Mayan people. The Greeks and Romans, however, gave this honour to Jupiter, and Babylonian astrology focused particularly on movements of the moon.

In Greek mythology two gods embodied the solar principle: Helios and Apollon (Apollo), the twin brothers of the moon goddess Artemis (Diana). Every day Helios left his palace in the East and drove a chariot across the sky drawn by four fiery steeds to another palace in the West. His journey was heralded by Eos, the dawn. He was able to see and hear everything and was therefore a witness at oaths. One morning, Phaeton, one of Helios' numerous sons, climbed into his chariot wishing to emulate his father, but he climbed too high and crashed down to Earth.

Apollo in earlier Greek literature was not specifically the sun god. He was particularly the god of prophecy, notably on behalf of his father Zeus (Jupiter). He was also one of the gods of arts (above all of music), the healing arts, and archery. Apollo was the son of Zeus, king of the gods and the female titan Leto. He was fed nectar and ambrosia as a child, a divine form of nourishment which imparted eternal youth and beauty. His most important worship was at Delphi, the place at which he had killed the clairvoyant snake Python. He also played the lute and the lyre, which he received from his half-brother Hermes (Mercury).

The subsequent association of Apollo with the sun probably stems from the similarity of his functions and nature with the Egyptian sun-god Horus. The ancient Egyptians called the sun the "Eye of Horus".

Despite Apollo's beauty and artistic talents, the young men and women he desired tried to avoid him, just as when the sun is able to radiate in all its glory it is too much for mortals to bear who must protect themselves from its dazzling light.

Apollo's oracle in Delphi had the maxim: "Know thyself, so that you may know God!". This is a fitting description of the sun's symbolism in the horoscope.

Interpretation
The sun symbolizes the life force itself and the central aspect of the personality. One of the principal tasks in life is to develop one's innate potential represented by the sun by Sign and [Hhouse]] position. It stands for an individual's basic identity. It indicates one's ego, or sense of self. This might help explain why most astrological newspaper columns mention only the so-called Star Sign or sun-sign: the sign of the zodiac in which the sun is placed. The sun does indeed have special significance in the horoscope, but it is not the basis for an entire chart interpretation.

The Moon and the Ascendant are equally important as the sun, although they have different qualities. The sun plays an active and creative role in the person's life, the moon shows how her needs can be met to best express her lunar nature. The ascendant indicates the person's body and outward personality. Depending on the sun's position, the native's sense of identity may be readily apparent to observers or be well-hidden from view.

The sun acts as the conductor in the orchestra of planets and has an integrating function. The sun's house and sign positions describe how and where an individual will feel and develop this energy. Any planets or axes the sun aspects will be integrated into this area of life.

Traditional astrologers generally view a planet conjunct the sun, with the exception of Mars, as weakened by its proximity to the sun's overwhelming light. Modern astrologers, in contrast, believe that a planet conjunct the sun will indicate qualities with which the person identifies. Planets in sextile or trine to the sun suggest heightened self-confidence; whereas hard aspects to the sun may indicate self-esteem issues.

A small child is not yet in a position to tap into the full energy of the sun, and the development and process of active integration usually begins from about the age of seven.

Any Transits by the sun last only one or two days and signify a process of increased awareness in the area concerned. Longer-lasting transits to the natal sun by other planets can either be times of enhanced self-confidence (trines, sextiles) or identity crises (square, opposition.)

The sun stands for the fatherly, masculine principle. In a more concrete sense it stands for the actual father or other figures of authority. In a man's horoscope the sun is part of his masculine identity, together with the planet Mars. Conversely, in a woman's horoscope the sun and Mars reveal her perception of the masculine principle and ideal man.[2] The sun and Leo also rule a range of emotions related to pride and even arrogance, honour, and political power.


Egyptian sun god Ra
Mundane Astrology
Because astrology emerged in highly structured societies of the past, where few people could hope to fully express their unique identities in powerful ways, the sun also indicates the people who could self-actualize: one's king or political ruler. In matters of a nation or a country the Sun particularly "represents the Prime Minister, aristocracy, magistrates, judges and all persons in authority and of distinction, Cabinet ministers and the like. It also represents public heroes and national champions."[3]

Medical Astrology
The heart, circulatory system, back and spine are associated with the sun.

St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is an important solar herb. Also Calendula officinalis (English marigold).

ChatGPT said:
Okay, Kim, let’s untangle this so it actually makes sense in practical astrological terms, especially considering the level-of-maturity and axis info you’ve pulled together. I’ll summarize and synthesize it so you can apply it without getting lost in the encyclopedic details.

Level of Maturity
Every planet, house, and sign comes with a spectrum: negative → neutral → positive. The key is how a person expresses it. Astrology gives tendencies, not fate.

Example from signs (short version):

Sign	Negative	Neutral	Positive
Aries	Aggressive	Active	Initiative
Taurus	Stubborn	Practical	Loyalty
Gemini	Dissipated	Open-minded	Versatile
Cancer	Clingy	Emotional ties	Warmth & Security
Leo	Self-aggrandizing	Self-expression	Generosity
Virgo	Pedantic	Attention to detail	Love of detail
Libra	Kitsch	Aesthetics	Beauty
Scorpio	Obsessive	Depth	Instinctual certainty
Sagittarius	Pomposity	Expansion	Grandeur
Capricorn	Miserly	Economy	Focus on essentials
Aquarius	Aloof	Detachment	Farsightedness
Pisces	Chaotic	Dissolving barriers	Unity
⚡ Takeaway: The same placement can be expressed destructively or maturely. Maturity is measured by conscious reflection and choice over life. Free will matters.

House Axes & Quadrants
Think of the chart as a cross (Axis Cross), which maps space & time in life:

Horizontal Axis: Ascendant → Descendant

Ascendant (1H) = self-image, how you show up

Descendant (7H) = how you relate to “other”

Axis = I/You perspective

Vertical Axis: IC → MC

IC (4H) = roots, past, family

MC (10H) = destiny, life goal, public identity

Axis = temporal perspective

Axes define themes across houses:

Axis	Houses	Theme
I/You	1–7	Self vs Other, Encounters
Substance	2–8	Values, possessions, letting go
Thought/Knowledge	3–9	Learning, ideas, travel
Individual	4–10	Roots & destiny, parental influence
Creativity/Relationship	5–11	Emotions, creativity, friendships
Existence/Transcendence	6–12	Work, inner growth, crises
Quadrants emerge from axes:

Eastern Hemisphere (personal, 1–3 & 10–12) → self-focused, initiating

Western Hemisphere (impersonal, 4–9 & 7–9) → relational, responsive

Diurnal Hemisphere (above horizon, 7–12) → public, extroverted

Nocturnal Hemisphere (below horizon, 1–6) → private, introverted

🌟 Takeaway: The chart is a map of where and how energies manifest, not just a collection of symbols.

Orb
Orbs = how far a planet can “reach” another in an aspect. Think of it as a halo of influence.

Major aspects (conjunct, opposition) allow bigger orbs; minor aspects (semi-square, quincunx) need tighter orbs.

Psychological astrology tends to allow wider orbs; horary or predictive requires precision.

Sun, Identity & Maturity
The Sun = core identity, ego, life force.

Sun in a sign + house = the field where personal potential develops.

Aspects to Sun = how confident or challenged one feels in expressing self.

Maturity factor: a child hasn’t integrated Sun energy; around age 7+ you start using it actively.

Symbolism: father principle, leadership, creative expression, honor/pride.

Example:

Sun in Leo → natural authority, pride, creativity; negative: arrogance, self-importance; positive: generosity, leadership.

Sun in Capricorn → responsibility, endurance; negative: harshness, rigidity; positive: discipline, mastery.

Putting it together
Assess the axes first → understand the life context: I/You, creativity, existence, etc.

Look at hemispheres/quadrants → introversion vs extroversion, personal vs relational focus.

Check planets + houses → see which energies are strong and where they’re directed.

Sun’s maturity path → key to ego integration and conscious expression.

Consider orbs/aspects → they fine-tune how energies interact.

If you want, I can make a visual cheat sheet that shows axes, quadrants, maturity spectrum, and sun energy integration all in one, so you can glance at a chart and see the “story” immediately instead of digging through all these blocks of text.

Do you want me to do that?

Affinent Ruler
Jump to navigationJump to search

The "Affiliations" of Thomas Ring (still without Pluto)
The term refers to the essential Dignity of the Sign Ruler in Classical Astrology.

Risk of Confusion: Co-Ruler

The actual Ruler is often referred to as the Main Ruler. Through the axis symmetry of the Horoscope along the Axis of 0 degrees Leo/Aquarius, the horoscope is divided into two halves. In classical astrology, only the Sun and the Moon were assigned a single Domicile, while every other Planet ruled over two signs. With the discovery of the planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, it became necessary to modify this system, and some of the planets that ruled over two signs had to vacate their throne in one sign.

Since the correspondence of these old rulers to the Signs, to which the new rulers were assigned, still exists, albeit somewhat weaker, they continue to be regarded as Affinent Rulers. To maintain symmetry, the new rulers are often mirrored into the signs that belong to the ancestral rulers along the Leo-Aquarius axis, and are now also considered Affinent Rulers there.

Affinent Rulers are in the following signs:

Scorpio: Mars
Sagittarius: Neptune[1]
Capricorn: Uranus[1]
Aquarius: Saturn
Pisces: Jupiter
Aries: Pluto[1] Accidental Dignities
Jump to navigationJump to search

Lilly's Table of Fortitudes and Debilities[1][2]
Accidental dignities are considerations used in Medieval and Renaissance astrology to denote when a planet is auspiciously placed in a chart, in ways that are additional, or “accidental”, compared to the essential dignities, which are based on zodiacal position.

Besides essential dignities we also have accidental dignities: a planet gains strength for many reasons other than its zodiacal position. Accidental dignity occurs when a planet is well-situated in a chart according to considerations such as house placement, due to fixed star conjunctions, or the speed of a planet.

To understand the difference between accidental dignity and essential dignity, think of essential dignity as being relevant to the 'nature' of the planet and accidental dignity as relevant to how that planet 'finds itself', or its 'power to act'. As an example, in a horary question, the significator for a lost valuable ring may have good essential dignity (it is valuable), but may have little accidental dignity (it is lost).

A planet can gain accidental dignity through a number of ways, but most often it is gained when the planet is found being direct, swift in motion, free from combustion or being Cazimi, in a beneficial aspect to a fortunate planet or conjunct a fixed star of a fortunate nature.

A planet benefits from accidental dignity when it conjuncts Jupiter or Venus (i.e., one of the Benefics), one of the chart Angles (cf. Elevation), or a beneficial fixed star.

Essential and accidental dignity have particular importance in some branches of astrology, such as Horary and Electional Astrology.

Dignity by House Placement
The first subsection of Accidental Dignities describes the strength a planet gains when located in one of the twelve Astrological Houses. Planets in the 10th House or the 1st House have the most strength, dignified by five points, as planets here “more forcibly show their effects”. Next in strength, dignified by four points, are the two angular houses in sequential order: the 7th and 4th houses, and the first Succedent House, the 11th house. Next, dignified by three points, we have two succedent houses, the 5th and 2nd houses. Finally, dignified by two points, we have the 9th house and dignified by one point: the 3rd house.

On the other hand, in the second column, Accidental Debilities, planets in the 12th house are debilitated by five points, and planets in the 8th and 6th house are debilitated by two points.

Lilly states that the dignity of each house is in this order: 1, 10, 7, 4, 11, 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 6, 12.[3]

Dignity by Planetary Motion and Speed
The next subsection in the table is the motion and speed of a planet. When a planet is direct, moving in zodiacal order, that planet will be dignified by four points. However, this rule does not apply to the Sun or the Moon, as these luminaries are always direct. However, if a planet is in retrograde motion, in reverse zodiacal order, then it will be debilitated by five points.

When a planet is “swift in motion”, moving faster than its daily mean motion, it is considered to be dignified by two points, but when a planet is moving slower than its daily mean motion, it is said to be debilitated by two points.

Oriental and Occidental
When Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are oriental of the sun, rising before the sun, it is said to be a positive placement and thus dignified by two points. However, if these planets are Occidental, setting after the sun, then they are debilitated by two points.

On the other hand, if Mercury and Venus are occidental, then it is considered a beneficial placement, then dignified by two points. However, if these planets are oriental, then it is considered to be debilitating and thus debilitated by two points.

When the Moon is increasing in light, when it is occidental of the Sun or moving towards it’s Full Moon Phase, then it is dignified by two points. However, if the moon is decreasing in light, otherwise known as being oriental or moving towards its New Moon Phase, then it is debilitated by two points.

Combustion and the Sun's Beams
When planets are not combust the sun and out the orb of the beams of the sun, further than 17º, then this planet is dignified by five points. However, when planets are within 17 arcseconds orb of being under the sun’s beams, then it is debilitated by four points, and if it is combust the sun, within 8º30’ of the sun, then it is debilitated by five points.

However, when a planet is within 17 arcseconds of the sun, or cazimi, then it is considered to be extremely dignified and thus attributed five points.

Aspects to Planets
Whenever a planet makes an exact conjunction, a partile aspect, with Jupiter or Venus, that planet is therefore dignified by five points, due to the Benefic nature of these planets. If that planet is conjunct the North Node, Trine Jupiter or Venus, then that planet is dignified by four points. Furthermore, if a planet is sextile to Jupiter or Venus, then it is dignified by three points.

On the other hand, when planets are in a partile conjunction to Saturn or Mars, it is extremely debilitated due to the Malefic nature of these planets, by five points. If this planet is conjunct the South Node, it is debilitated by four points. If a planet is in a partile opposition to Saturn or Mars, this planet is therefore debilitated by four points, and debilitated by three points if it is in a partile square.

Additionally, when a planet is besieged between Saturn and Mars, within the orb of each planet, it is considered to be greatly debilitated and done so by five points.

Other factors may contribute to a planet being accidentally debilitated, including the planet being retrograde or aspecting a Fixed Star with a harmful influence.

Fixed Stars
In the last subsection of the table, Lilly points out benefic and malefic fixed stars that can either dignify or debilitate a planet.

If a planet is conjunct the Fixed Stars Regulus, now at 0º Virgo, then it will have the most accidental dignity in the entire table, being dignified by six points. If a planet is conjunct Spica, now at 24º of Libra, then these planets are considered to be incredibly dignified, by five points. These fixed stars give a planet such strength because of the benefic nature these fixed stars have. However, if a planet is conjunct the Fixed Star Algol, 26º of Taurus, then it is considered to be heavily debilitated by five points, due to the malefic nature of this fixed star.

A planet which is conjunct one of the four horoscope axes (Ascendant, Descendant, Medium Coeli, Imum Coeli).

Angular planets are dominant planets. Axial Connection
Jump to navigationJump to search
A planet is said to form an axial connection when it forms one of the main aspects to one of the main axes. For example, a planet that forms a Trine to the Ascendant also forms a Sextile to the Descendant.

A planet in this position is said to be dominant and therefore of great significance, particularly when conjunct the Ascendant, Descendant, Medium Coeli or Imum Coeli. A planet forming an aspect to an axis also influences the character of that axis. Put rather simply, a Leo Ascendant in conjunction with Pluto would exhibit some of the qualities of a Scorpio Ascendant. Malefics
Jump to navigationJump to search

Greene's classic
Malefic is a term used in Traditional Astrology for Mars and Saturn, which were thought to have a harmful influence.

The "greater malefic" is Saturn; and the "lesser malefic", Mars.

This is derived from a convention in ancient Greek texts where these two planets were referred to as “bad-doers” or “evildoers” (kakopoios)[1], because they were viewed as providing negative or destructive significations in an astrological chart.

When well-situated in a horoscope, however, their negative impacts decreases and they might even be helpful to the individual or event. Robert Hand: "A malefic does not easily produce results which would be considered "good". Generally speaking malefics are not so much "bad" as it is that they require more thought, more consciousness, and more skill at managing life ... In fact the two main malefics, Mars and Saturn, are necessary for building character and strength. But either of these handled without consciousness leads to less than fortunate results. The natural malefics are Mars, Saturn and the Sun by conjunction only... A malefic is a planet whose natural influence leads to extremes and imbalance."

There is also a concept that is used in Indian astrology where some planets can become “functionally malefic” as a result of ruling certain houses, which means that even though they are not inherently one of the malefic planets, they may come to have some negative or malefic influence in the chart based on their condition in it.

Modern astrologers largely reject any judgmental or deterministic interpretation of benefics or malefics, in the view that Saturn and Mars even can be beneficial when they are well-aspected and their energies are used constructively by the individual, just as the energies of a seemingly beneficial planet can be poorly deployed.

Mars is the first planet whose orbit around the sun lies outside that of the earth and is therefore considered to be the first of the outer planets (although astrologers also consider Mars to be a personal planet.) Its equatorial diameter of 6794.4 km makes it only half the size of the Earth.

Its average distance from the Sun is 227.9 million km and has an orbital period of 687 days (about two Earth years). Its maximum diurnal movement is 52 arc minutes with the average being 31 minutes. Because its glow appeared red to ancient astrologers (who had no word for the color orange) it is often called the "red planet".


Mars by the artist Gertrud Ring[1]
Mythology
Liz Greene[2]: In the myths of every ancient people, the gods of war have always occupied a prominent and honored place. War was personified by these fierce gods as the glorious expression of the human fighting spirit - not merely bloodthirsty and cruel, but also disciplined, courageous, honorable and directed toward a noble goal.

The war gods of myth are almost always portrayed battling with a monster - an image not merely of the outer enemy, but also of the bestial dark force within human beings which must be conquered for the sake of humanity. Hercules, the quintessential Greco-Roman warrior hero, battled the Hydra and the Nemean Lion to free the people from destruction.

The gods of war symbolize not only the raw struggle for survival, but also the instinct to champion the weak, and defend the integrity of the soul as well as the life of the body. In Babylonian myth, the war god, Marduk, battled with his mother, the sea monster Tiamat, and carved heaven and earth out of her dismembered body.

In Egypt, the fighting spirit was represented not by a god, but by a goddess - the lion-headed Sekhmet, daughter of the sun god Ra and dispenser of divine vengeance.

In Norse myth, the ferocious Thor, personification of the Viking berserker, wielded his thunderbolts from the vault of heaven to smite the enemy. The Greek god of war was the flamboyant and virile Ares, who, according to Homer in The Iliad, was hairy, sweaty and three hundred feet tall.

Known to the Romans as Mars, he fathered the twins Romulus and Remus who founded the city of Rome, and thus achieved his apogee in the classical world as the personification of Roman military might.

Ares (in Latin: Mars) was the god of war and one of the twelve Olympians. The son of Zeus and Hera, his siblings and descendants vary, depending upon the version of the myth. Ares did not seem to marry, but among his affairs the most prominent one was with Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of love and beauty. As the symbol of male passion Ares fathered Eros (Cupid) with Aphrodite.

Ares is usually portrayed riding a chariot being pulled by two horses, Deimos (terror) and Phobos (fear) although sometimes Deimos and Phobos are considered to be his attendants or children. Ares symbolized the wild, unrestrained fight, usually involving great bloodshed. Rather than being the strategist who goes into battle with a plan, he was the firebrand with raw irrepressible power. Ares' choleric and argumentative temperament on and off the battlefield made him unpopular among gods and humans alike; he was therefore rarely honoured with temples.

Ares was the patron god of warriors, and the 8th century BC Homeric Hymn to Ares makes explicit the link between the god and the planet Mars.

"Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the spear, o defender of Olympos, father of warlike Nike (Victory), ally of Themis, stern governor of the rebellious, leader of the righteous men, sceptred King of manliness, who whirl your fiery sphere [the planet Mars] among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the ether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of men, giver of dauntless youth! Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life, and strength of war, that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul." [3]

The Roman god Mars, prior to the introduction of Ares from Greece, was originally a god of vegetation. With the increasing militarisation of Roman society Mars became associated with the Greek god Ares and his myths were applied to Mars, as well.


Mars rules Scorpio and Aries

Mars in Ulla Janascheck's oracular game[4]
Rulerships
Mars is the traditional ruler of Scorpio (Pluto being the modern ruler) and the sole ruler of Aries. It is in detriment in Libra and Taurus, exalted in Capricorn, and falls in Cancer. In traditional astrology Mars is considered to be malefic.

The male sexual organs are associated with Mars, together with muscles, blood and arteries. Mars rules athletes as well as warriors and implements of war. Mars' association with cutting instruments may account for its rulership of surgeons. In a man's chart Mars indicates his masculinity and male sexuality. In a heterosexual woman's chart, Mars shows the kind of man to whom she is attracted. In either sex, Mars indicates one's innate assertiveness and aggression.

Interpretation
According to Dane Rudhyar, Mars "is the desire to move away from the center... It symbolizes all beginnings, all initiating impulses; self-projection as a release of sheer energy"[5] Its house and sign position show where and how an individual initiates action, and goes about achieving something or asserting oneself. It also indicates the way an individual is likely to expend energy and get moving. Mars is associated with all kinds of instinctual drives and symbolises the personal will and love of conquest. But it can also stand for uncontrolled aggression, anger and rage. It describes sexual energy.

If the sun is the "hero" of one's personal hero's journey in life, Mars is like the "hero's sword and fighting spirit" necessary to defend him and accomplish his mission.[6]

In a man's horoscope Mars represents his masculine identity. The sun indicates his core identity, but Mars gives that identity its expression as a male in the world. In a woman's horoscope Mars indicates her own initiative and aggression, as well as the type of man she finds attractive.


Mars in his chariot pulled by Deimos and Phobos[7]
When natal Mars is in aspect to other planets or an axis it dynamises and activates the horoscope factor involved. In a difficult aspect it can indicate either someone who becomes embroiled in quarrels or who attracts quarrelsome people. Natal Mars retrograde can indicate someone with self-esteem issues because all of Mars's natural aggression is turned inward.

When transiting Mars aspects other planets it energises and motivates them to action, although the influence of Mars transits is usually felt only for a couple of days. (Mars usually spends two days in a single degree.) However, Mars transits that occur during periods of retrograde movement are more significant because it can then aspect the same horoscope factor three times. Mercury

Astronomy
Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. Its orbit, like that of Venus, is inside the earth's own orbit, so it is never further than 28 degrees away from the sun as viewed from earth (elongation). Consequently Mercury is always in the same sign as the sun or in an adjacent one. It has an equatorial diameter of 4876 km which means that is not even half the earth's size. Its average distance from the sun is 57.91 million km. It takes 88 days (sidereal) to orbit the sun and between 12 and 14 months to travel through the whole zodiac. Its maximum diurnal movement is 2 degrees and 25 minutes.

Like Venus, Mercury can be both an evening star or a morning star. It is an evening star and located before the sun in the zodiac when it descends after the sun on the western horizon and a morning star when it rises before the sun on the eastern horizon.

Physical characteristics
Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3.
Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System.

Radar observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun.

Hermes (with his petasus and caduceus)[2]
Mythology
The Greek god Hermes (Latin: Mercury) was the son of Zeus (Jupiter) and the titan Maia who was the daughter of Atlas, the bearer of the celestial sphere. His father chose him early on to be his messenger because he was swift, cunning, eloquent and diplomatic. No one could really get angry with him. His most important characteristics were his winged sandals and caduceus garlanded with two snakes. He was the god of travellers, traders, craftsmen, players and thieves.

Hermes displayed his exceptional talents almost immediately after his birth. He made his first lyre from a turtle's shell and soon after stole fifty cattle from Apollo's herd. He wrapped the cattle's hooves in foliage, led them away backwards by their tails and, after he had hidden them, lay back down in his cradle. He feigned innocence in front of his half-brother but was nevertheless betrayed and was forced to appear before Zeus, whereupon he also stole Apollo's bow. Zeus ordered him to return the animals but Hermes managed to avoid this. He played on his lyre for Apollo and offered it to him in exchange. Apollo was so taken with the instrument that he immediately agreed and the two became inseparable friends after Hermes also returned his bow.

The mythology of Hermes/Mercury suggests a Mesopotamian origin in his parallels with the Babylonian scribe god Nabu (Nebo) who in turn was probably an evolution of the Sumerian goddess of grain, astronomy, and accounting, Nisaba (Nidaba). The Greeks also saw parallels between Hermes and the Egyptian scribe god Thoth, who was, however, associated with the moon. In the Hellenized culture of Roman Egypt, Hermes was associated with esoteric lore on magic, medicine, theology, and astrology. He was known as Hermes Trismegistus ("three-times great") or in combination with the Egyptian god of the dead Anubis, as Hermanubis. In this latter form, the Egyptianized Hermes/Hellenized Anubis served primarily as the conductor of the dead (psychopomp) on their journey through the afterlife. He was the only figure allowed to leave the kingdom of Hades after entering it.

Hermes sent people dreams and accompanied the dead on their journey to the underworld.

Liz Greene[3]: He was tricky and unfathomable, lord of travelers and merchants, patron of thieves and liars, guide of the souls of the dead and messenger of the Olympian gods. The Romans knew him as Mercury, from which both the metal and the planet derive their name. The mysterious gift of human thought prompted the Greek poet, Menander, to write that the intellect in every human being was divine. In ancient myth, the powers of reflection, speech and communication are personified by a clever, quicksilver deity who taught human beings to write, build, navigate and calculate the course of the heavenly bodies. This enigmatic god symbolizes not only our capacity to think, but also the planning and organizing faculty which allows us to name and categorize the myriad components of the chaotic natural world.

In Egypt, the god Thoth, portrayed sometimes as an ibis and sometimes as a baboon, was the patron of science and literature, wisdom and inventions, the spokesman of the gods and their keeper of records. Creator of the alphabet and endowed with total knowledge, Thoth invented arithmetic, surveying, geometry, astrology, medicine, musie and writing.

In Norse myth, this elusive and multifaceted god was called Loki, lord of fire, and an incorrigible manipulator. In Teutonic myth, he was known as Wotan, patron of magic and lord of the wild hunt, who sacrificed one of his eyes for the gift of wisdom.

Rulerships
The spinal cord, which carries information in two directions, is associated with Mercury: The brain sends movement impulses to the muscles and receives sensory perceptions in return. It is also linked to the nervous system, the body's "news system", as well as to the respiratory organs which "transport" air. Mercury also rules the hands.

Mercury is the traditional ruler of astrology. (Uranus is the modern ruler.) The association of the god Mercury with astrology goes back to ancient times, when it was explained as the relationship of Atlas - bearer of the celestial sphere - with his grandson, the god of knowledge and intelligence.

In keeping with the god's mythology, the planet Mercury rules trade, thieves, liars, messengers, literacy, communication, and intelligence. As a symbol of the human mind, he has the ability to travel vicariously to different places, and to contemplate life after death. In ruling the hands, Mercury is associated with craftsmen as well as handwriting and typing.

Mercury rules two signs: Gemini and Virgo; the latter possibly indicating a connection with the Sumerian grain and astronomy goddess, Nisaba. He is also exalted in Virgo. It is in detriment in Sagittarius and Pisces; the former contrasting Gemini's collection and communication of information, and Sagittarius as exploring the "big picture." Mercury falls in Pisces.

Interpretation
Mercury embodies the principles of perception and orientation in the world. Its domain includes the assimilation and application of information. Mercury is therefore the symbol of thought processes, discriminative faculties and the intellect. Its house and sign position in the horoscope indicate how and what an individual learns.

When Mercury aspects another planet or axis the characteristics of the horoscope factor in question are present in an individual's thought process and communication. For example, a Venus conjunction softens the individual's speech, whereas a Mars conjunction promotes forthright or aggressive speech.

Transiting Mercury heightens perception in the area affected, although this influence usually only lasts for a few days because Mercury moves so quickly. Periods of Mercury retrograde are notorious for missed communications, misunderstandings, and disrupted transportation schedules. Just as natal Mercury retrograde represents a mind constantly looking inward on itself, Mercury retrograde by transit is a good time for introspection. Metal

Instruction beneath the Tree of Metals[1]
There are seven basic metals in Alchemy which for centuries was closely related to astrology. The refinement of these metals was a symbolic process that showed parallels with the strive for human perfection.

Planets
The seven classical planets are related to the seven base metals of alchemy as follows:

Sun (sol) Sun.gif: Gold
Moon (luna) Lun.gif: Silver
Mercury (mercurius) Mer.gif: Quicksilver
Venus Ven.gif: Copper
Mars Mar.gif: Iron
Jupiter Jup.gif: Tin
Saturn Sat.gif: Lead
In antiquity a different classification system was used, with Venus associated with tin, Mercury with iron, Jupiter with bronze and Mars with alloyed metals.

There are strict rules in Alchemy regarding the process of transforming base metals into precious ones. Lead/Saturn, which in astrology also stands for the material principle, forms the basis. The sought after goal was to create gold/Sun, the symbol for the spiritual and divine principle in astrology. The planets also showed alchemists the way to achieve their other sought after goal, the philosopher's stone. This stone was a legendary substance capable of turning base metals into precious ones that alchemist's believed could be created in seven stages out of virgin soil.

In the astrology of the Middle-Ages these relationships were not only of interest to alchemists but had much wider practical significance.

Ruler of the Day
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see what you’ve pulled together here—this is a deep dive into some classical astrology concepts: Affinent rulers, accidental dignities, planetary rulerships, and the historical alchemical/astrological connections with metals. Let me break it down clearly so you can see the patterns and how it all fits together.

1. Affinent Rulers
These are basically “honorary rulers” of zodiac signs.

In classical astrology, each planet has a “main” sign it rules (like Mars → Aries, Venus → Taurus). But after the discovery of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, some older rulerships got a “shadow” role. That’s the Affinent Ruler.

Example:

Scorpio: Mars (traditional), Pluto (modern), Mars still holds affinity.

Sagittarius: Neptune (modern “mirrored” ruler)

Capricorn: Uranus

Aquarius: Saturn

Pisces: Jupiter

Aries: Pluto

Think of it like a kingdom: the new ruler sits on the throne, but the ancestral ruler still has influence behind the scenes.

2. Accidental Dignities
Essential dignity = inherent “power” of a planet by zodiacal placement (Aries Mars is naturally strong).

Accidental dignity = context-based strength: where a planet is in a chart and what it’s doing.

Key ways planets gain accidental dignity:
House placement: Angular houses (1st, 10th) are strongest; 12th is weakest.

Motion and speed: Direct, swift planets gain strength; retrograde or slow planets are weakened.

Oriental/Occidental placement: Depends on relation to the Sun.

Sun’s beams: Cazimi (conjunct Sun within 17') is super strong; combustion (too close) is debilitated.

Aspects: Conjunction/trine/sextile to benefics (Jupiter, Venus) strengthens; to malefics (Mars, Saturn) weakens.

Fixed stars: Regulus, Spica, etc., boost dignity; Algol debilitates.

Simple analogy: Essential dignity = your “default talent,” Accidental dignity = how circumstances let you use that talent effectively.

3. Angular Planets / Axial Connection
Planets near key chart axes (Ascendant, Descendant, MC, IC) are powerful.

They “dynamize” whatever house or sign they’re in, influencing personal character strongly.

4. Malefics
Classical malefics = Mars (lesser) and Saturn (greater).

Their natural energy is challenging, disruptive, or aggressive, but necessary for building character, discipline, and resilience.

Modern view: Mars/Saturn aren’t inherently “bad”—they’re just high-octane tools; how you use them matters.

5. Planetary Mythology & Rulerships
Mars/Ares → Aries and Scorpio, drives aggression, action, sexual energy, and assertion.

Mercury/Hermes → Gemini and Virgo, governs intellect, communication, and travel.

The myths inform planetary symbolism in charts (e.g., Mars = fighting spirit; Mercury = trickster intelligence).

6. Metals & Astrology
Each planet corresponds to a metal, largely based on classical alchemy:

Sun → Gold

Moon → Silver

Mercury → Quicksilver

Venus → Copper

Mars → Iron

Jupiter → Tin

Saturn → Lead

Signs have metal associations too, e.g., Aries = Iron, Gemini = Quicksilver, Capricorn = Lead.

This was historically used in magic, medicine, and alchemy alongside astrology.

💡 Big Picture:
All these systems—essential dignity, accidental dignity, affinent rulers, malefics, metals—interlock. They create a layered map of planetary influence: the innate potential of planets (essential), the current context/power (accidental), the hidden ancestral influence (affinent), and the mythic/metallurgical symbolism.

If you want, I can make a visual chart showing Affinent rulers, essential & accidental dignity, and metals together, so you can literally see how everything interrelates in a single zodiac map. That’s super handy for practical chart work or horary readings.

Do you want me to do that?

Jump to navigationJump to search
Der natural ruler of a House is the Ruler that corresponds to the Sign Ruler associated with that particular house. For example, the Zodiac Sign Aries is the first sign of the Zodiac, and its ruler is Mars. Thus, Mars is referred to as the natural ruler of the first House.

The natural ruler should be distinguished from the actual house ruler. The actual house ruler is determined by the Zodiac Sign that is at the Cusp of the respective house. It is assumed that the energies of the natural ruler of a house are expressed particularly harmoniously within that house.

Astronomy
Neptune, along with Uranus and Pluto, is one of the trans-Saturnian planets discovered since the invention of the telescope. It was discovered on 23rd September 1846 by Gottfried Galle, after Joseph Le Verrier predicted Neptune's presence based on the gravitational disturbances it caused to the orbit of Uranus. Galileo Galilei already had seen Neptune on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, but he thought it to be a moon of Jupiter or a Fixed Star.

Neptune has an estimated diameter of 49,530 km, which makes it almost four times as large as the earth. It has an average distance to the sun of 4519 million km. Neptune needs almost 164 years to make one sidereal orbit of the sun. It has a maximal daily movement of 2.25 minutes of arc, although its average diurnal movement is 24 seconds of arc. Neptune has a ring system similar to Saturn's. Its striking deep blue colour was first discovered by Voyager 2 in 1989, long after it was named after the Roman god of the oceans.

Mythology

Astrological Neptune[3]
In Greek mythology Poseidon (Latin Neptune) ruled the oceans. He and his brothers Zeus (Jupiter), god of the sky and supreme ruler, and Hades (Pluto), god of the underworld, divided the universe between them after they conquered their father Kronos (Saturn). Neptune lived with his wife Amphitrite in an underwater palace.

Similar to his brother Zeus, Poseidon had many affairs and was not averse to using force or cunning when his desire for women was not reciprocated. He was also highly emotional and tempestuous. He raced through the oceans at great speed in his chariot, and his appearance was often accompanied by sea- or earthquakes. If he felt that humans were not paying him enough respect he sent floods to punish them.

Poseidon could never accept the fact that his brother Zeus ruled over the heavens and earth's surface. He repeatedly sought the aid of others, including Zeus' wife Hera, to overthrow the king of the gods, something he was never able to do.

Poseidon could also be very compassionate and willing to help others. When the people of Greece needed new lands, he transformed a large area of sea into the region of Thessaly and he saved many sailors from drowning. He also made the twins Castor and Polydeuces the patron saints of shipping. With his help they were able to calm storms. People turned to Poseidon for protection from earthquakes.

Liz Greene[4]: Water is portrayed, in myth, as the womb of all living things and the source to which life returns to be reborn. In Sumer, the goddess of the sea was called Nammu, Mother of All. In Babylon, she was known as Tiamat and was depicted as a vast aquatic monster who gave birth to all the gods, then was eventually dismembered to make the heavens and the earth. In Hindu myth, the great goddess Maya personifies the boundless cosmic ocean out of which one universe after another emerges, only to dissolve into the primal waters again when its cycle has been fulfilled.

In the archaie tales of Pelasgian Greece, the goddess Eurynome first created the ocean and danced upon its waves, coupling with a serpent to generate the cosmos. In later Greek myth, her image fragmented into many elusive deities of lake, river and spring, and every stream had its presiding nymph. The great god Okeanos also makes his appearance in Greek myth, encircling the globe of the earth with his ever-flowing and ever-fertile body.

As the worship of the ancient mother goddesses was gradually superseded by the dynamic Olympian gods, the amorphous sea goddess Eurynome was pensioned off and blue-haired Poseidon, lord of earthquakes, bulls and horses, inherited the rulership of the sea. This powerful deity, capricious, temperamental and unfathomable as the waters over which he presided, was known to the Romans as Neptune, after whom the planet is named.

Rulerships
Modern astrologers associate Neptune with the water sign of Pisces. Jupiter is the traditional ruler of Pisces.

Neptune is associated with the pituitary gland, sometimes described as the seat of the "third eye". It opens the door to dimensions which are beyond the realm of ordinary senses. The pituitary gland in certain fish and chameleons produces a hormone which enables them to change their skin colour to blend into their environment, suggestive of astrological Neptune's illusory qualities. In humans the pituitary gland is also thought to be the location of the sixth chakra Anja, which is considered to be one of the body's most spiritual energy centres and a symbol of universal love.

Neptune in modern astrology rules over a range of water-associated phenomena that traditional astrologers associated with the moon. Neptune also rules smoking and mind-altering drugs and alcohol, as well as illnesses that elude diagnosis.


Neptune and Salacia or Amphitrite[6]
Interpretation
Neptune, together with Uranus and Pluto, belongs to the triumvirate of spiritual planets which point to dimensions beyond the boundaries of the material world symbolised by Saturn. Neptune's elusive qualities make them difficult to put into words. Whereas Uranus allows the entry into another dimension by breaking through the boundaries set by Saturn, Neptune dissolves these boundaries in an almost imperceptible but no less powerful way, similar to water dissolving rocks.

When manifested constructively, Neptune stands for the human longing to merge with a more encompassing whole, for transcendance and spirituality. It is a symbol of inspiration. Whereas Jupiter rules theology and established organized religions, Neptune operates at the level of mysticism.

Saturn represents the qualities of concrete, material reality. Neptune, in contrast, symbolizes the world of illusion and disillusionment in which tangible reality has no place. Thus Neptune has a positive expression in the arts, notably film; in which beautiful images may seem very real, but are artifacts of the production techniques. Neptune is also the alcoholic's high followed by the morning-after hangover. Neptune can symbolize outright deception, or where the person is overly idealistic or deluded.

Because Neptune has a long orbital period it spends on average fourteen years in one sign of the zodiac, so that its sign position is a generational factor. For this reason, Neptune's position by sign in an individual's horoscope is considered to be less important than the aspects it makes to personal planets and its house position. The latter shows where an individual has access to intangible spiritual dimensions of being and where s/he can learn to follow the voice of intuition and develop a deeper trust in the flow of life. The house position also indicates where the individual may become the victim of delusion or suffer disappointments. It can also show where he/she may have addictive tendencies or view things in a naive way.

Transiting Neptune dissolves existing structures that have become obsolete. Positively, a Neptune transit to Venus might be a time when an artist becomes more creative; or a spiritual person has a very idealistic relationship. A hard aspect from transiting Neptune to the sun or in the 6th house of health may be a time when the person suffers from low vitality, as Neptune erodes what it touches.

Do Neptunian insights signify the true clarity about existence beyond material reality? Or merely delusion and wishful thinking? It would not be Neptune if we could answer these questions with certainty.  Cardinal Sin

Detail from "The Garden of Earthly Delights" by Hieronymus Bosch[1]
In the late Middle Ages and early modern period, the Seven Deadly Sins formed one of the most important moral-theological teachings.

Sins arise according to classical theology from seven bad character traits:

Pride (Vanity, Arrogance) - (Latin) Superbia
Greed (Avarice) - Avaritia
Lust (Debauchery, Hedonism, Desire) - Luxuria
Anger (Wrath, Revenge) - Ira
Gluttony (Gorging, Excess, Selfishness) - Gula
Envy (Jealousy, Resentment) - Invidia
Sloth (Cowardice, Ignorance, Laziness of the Heart) - Acedia
These character traits are referred to as the main vices and are summarized under the acronym SALIGIA[2]. They were considered the cause of many sins and can lead to both grave and venial sins. Since the main vices are the cause and thus the root of sins, they were also referred to as "root sins."

History
The first categorization of human vices can be found with Evagrius Ponticus at the end of the 4th century. He names eight negative traits that can afflict monks. For him, Invidia was not included, but in addition to those mentioned above, Vana Gloria (Vanity) and Tristitia (Sadness) were. Pope Gregory I († 604) assigned Sadness to Acedia, Vanity to Pride, and added Envy to the list of sins.

Even then, certain demons were associated with the main vices. The most widespread associations are those of Peter Binsfeld from the 16th century. He associates Lucifer with Pride, Mammon with Greed, Leviathan with Envy, Satan with Anger, Asmodeus with Lust, Beelzebub with Gluttony, and Belphegor with Sloth.

In medieval theology, the main vices are often contrasted with the cardinal virtues. Several Church Fathers and theologians dealt with the main sins and contributed to their systematization. Pope Gregory I contrasted them with the "Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit."

Deadly Sins and Planets
The most common association of the deadly sins or main vices with the planets was:

Pride = A39_209.gif Sun

Superbia - Pride, Arrogance, Vanity, Vanity
Sloth = A35_150.gif Moon

Acedia: Laziness of the Heart/Mind (Sloth, Apathy)
Envy = A34_146.gif Mercury

Invidia - Resentment, Jealousy
Lust = A34_146.gif Venus

Luxuria - Unchastity
Anger = A33_140.gif Mars

Ira - Wrath, Retribution, Revenge
Gluttony = A29_112.gif Jupiter

Gula - Gorging, Excess, Immoderation, Selfishness
Greed = A26_087.gif Saturn

Avaritia - Greed (Avarice, Covetousness)

The Ship of Fools by Sebastian Brant[3]
Seven Virtues
The seven virtues have always been recommended by the Church as countermeasures:

Deadly Sin	Cardinal Virtue
Pride	Humility
Sloth	Diligence
Envy	Charity
Lust	Chastity
Wrath	Gentleness
Gluttony	Abstinence
Greed	Poverty
Thus, Pride is healed by Humility, Sloth by Diligence, Envy by Charity, Lust by Chastity, Wrath by Gentleness, Gluttony by Abstinence, and Greed by Poverty.

In the heart of the sun[1]: favourable or harmful?
Cazimi is an Arab term for a planet in very close conjunction to the Sun, i.e. when it is located within 17 minutes. So the planet literally is situated "in the heart of the sun."


Contents

Etymology
Cazimi is a Latin transliteration of the Arabic term kaṣmīmī, which means “as if in the the heart”. The Arabic term appears to be a translation of the Greek term egkardios (ἐγκάρδιος), which literally means “in the heart”.

History
The Greek term and the concept appear for the first time in the work of Rhetorius of Egypt, who lived sometime around the 6th or 7th century CE.

Later the concept appears in Arabic in the work of Sahl ibn Bishr in the early 9th century.

Eventually it started showing up in Medieval Latin works in the 12th and 13th centuries, such as for example in the work of Guido Bonatti.

Astrology
The astrological significance of the concept is that it was thought to be an ameliorating and strengthening factor for planets.

In Traditional Western Astrology planets that get close to a conjunction with the Sun, especially within 15 degrees, are thought to be weakened because their light is obscured or overpowered by the light of the Sun. Cazimi appears to have been introduced as an exception to that general rule, so that when a planet is within a specific range of the Sun it is no longer harmed.

There appears to have been some disagreement amongst some early Medieval sources about how close a planet must get to the Sun before it is considered to be “in the heart” or cazimi:

According to Rhetorius and Sahl a planet is considered to be “in the heart” as soon as it comes within one degree of a conjunction with the Sun. According to al-Qabisi and Bonatti a planet is considered to be “in the heart” as soon as it comes within 16 minutes of a conjunction with the Sun.

It seems that the earlier authors defined the concept according to the wider value of one degree, whereas most of the later Medieval and Renaissance astrologers used the tighter value of 16 minutes.

In Horary Astrology and Traditional Astrology this is viewed as a very favourable placement; unlike planets that are conjunct the sun, but further out.

Jump to navigationJump to search

Venus rules the signs Libra and Taurus[1]
The planet that rules the sign on the Ascendant in the natal chart.

When interpreting the chart, the house position and sign of the ruling planet are considered to be significant factors. These indicate where (house) and how (sign of the zodiac) an individual's basic disposition (Ascendant) will be expressed. This additional information helps to give a more nuanced description of the Ascendant.

Chronocrator[2]
The term chronocrator is a transliteration of a Greek term that was used in Hellenistic astrology in order to refer to a planet has been activated in a chart for a certain span of time according to a particular timing technique.

The Greek term chronocrator literally means “time-lord”, because the planet is activated as a lord or ruler in the chart for a specific period of time.

There were several different techniques that were used in the Hellenistic tradition for determining when a planet would be activated as a chronocrator.

The most widespread time-lord technique in the Hellenistic tradition was annual Profections. In the most common variation of the technique, a single planet is activated as a time-lord for each year of the native’s life.

The seven Klassical planets[1]
The planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn which have been known since at least - and probably before - the rise of ancient civilizations.

Astrologers added the Sun and the Moon to these, as "planets" in astrology if not in astronomy, making a total of seven, a number which is considered to have special mystical significance.

The ancient Greeks used the word planet - which literally means wanderer - to differentiate between other celestial bodies within our solar system such as comets and the so-called fixed stars, whose movements were routine and predictable. All of the seven classical planets are visible to the naked eye. Classical ruler
Jump to navigationJump to search

Zodiac and Classical Rulers[1]
The "classical rulers" are those Sign Rulers that were the sole rulers of the zodiac signs until the discovery of Uranus. They are also referred to as the seven sacred planets.

According to the Chaldean Order, these seven are also responsible for one day of the week each.

The arrangement of the celestial bodies in the Diurnal Hemisphere (on the right side of the image) is based on their distance from the Sun, or their orbital periods around the Sun. The Sun serves as the starting point, followed by Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In the Nocturnal Hemisphere (on the left side of the image), the illuminated Moon is the relevant light, or the fastest planet, which leads the sequence. The order of the other planets is determined by reflection along the Axis 0° Leo/0° Aquarius, which marks the boundary between day and night, or the Domicile of the Sun and that of the Moon.

Thus, the following reflections occur:
Mercury from Gemini in Virgo
Venus from Taurus in Libra
Mars from Aries in Scorpio
Jupiter from Pisces in Sagittarius
Saturn from Capricorn in Aquarius
The two Lights Sun and Moon each govern only one sign
The different characteristics of the mirrored signs, which each have the same ruler, are explained through the Gender of the signs: For example, Jupiter in Pisces expresses itself in a feminine-introverted manner, while in Sagittarius it expresses itself in a masculine-extroverted manner.
The Moon is in Cancer in the quintessential feminine sign, just as the Sun is in Leo in the most masculine of all signs.

Since we still only have ten planets available even after the discovery of the trans-Saturnian planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto), Mercury and Venus are still considered double rulers (i.e., rulers of two signs). Traditional astrology and Horary Astrology still predominantly work only with the classical planets.

This type of assignment of zodiac signs, or their rulers, through reflection along an axis is also called Parallel connection. Oriental
Jump to navigationJump to search
Oriental may simply mean "eastern," in terms of which Quadrant of the horoscope it occupies.
An oriental planet (especially, "oriental of the Sun" planet), however, has the more precise meaning of the Planet just east of the sun, and which will rise and set before it.
The Moon is actually east of the sun whenever it is increasing in light, regardless of its hemisphere in the horoscope.

The oriental planet in natal chart interpretation may highlight special skills and qualities of the individual's personality that could otherwise be missed.[1]

William Lilly, author of the classic textbook on horary and traditional forms of astrology, used the oriental and "western" status of a planet to predict people's physical characteristics and the likely outcome of various questions and undertakings. For example, if the lord of the ninth house of overseas travel were a swift-moving, oriental planet, it indicated a speedy journey.[2]

Astronomy
Planets are out-of-bounds when their declination is more than the obliquity of the ecliptic (23°27'5" in 1900, 23°26'16" in 2000, 23°25'43 in 2100) either north or south of the equator. The degree bounds, in this case, are the maximum northward and southward migration of the sun at the solstices, from an earth-based perspective. Cartographers often draw lines called the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn on maps and globes, showing this maximum migration of the sun as degrees of north and south latitude, respectively.

Because planets orbiting around the sun on the ecliptic sometimes are north or south of the ecliptic, they can have a greater declination than the current obliquity, by several degrees.

History
Katherine Boehrer (1994) is credited with the original research and coining of the term.[1]
Some ideas to this concept were inspired by American astrologer Steven Forrest.

How often OOB
The most common bodies to be out-of-bounds in a horoscope are Mars, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Pluto, Uranus.
Also some of the Asteroids.
Jupiter is very rarely oob.
Never out-of-bounds are the Sun, the Lunar nodes, Neptune, Chiron.[2] Saturn has not gone out of bounds since a long time. It was most recently the case in September 253 CE, before that in the years 18, 47, 106, 165, and 194 CE.

In the Astrodienst ephemerides (picture below; variant with latitude and declination) the declination is displayed in red if it is 'out of bounds'. The out-of-bonds declination also appears in red in our data tables (PDF) for horoscope drawings
Interpretation
Out-of-bounds planets supposedly act independently, and in an unsocialized but potentially creative manner.
They can function very well in a horoscope, though. For example, an out-of-bounds moon might appear in its own sign of Cancer and be well-aspected. However, it has a reputation for behaving in original, unusual or eccentric ways.
ChatGPT said:
Wow, that’s a deep dive into astrological planetary concepts! Let me break it down in a way that connects all these pieces into a coherent picture, while highlighting how they interrelate in modern and traditional astrology.

1. Most Significant Planet / Dominant Planet
The most significant planet in a chart is essentially the one that has the strongest influence, usually because it forms the most important aspects to key points (angles/axes) in the chart.

This planet often acts like a personal signature, shaping your personality and core life themes.

It’s not necessarily the Sun or Moon; sometimes a minor planet or transpersonal planet like Neptune can dominate, especially if it’s heavily aspected.

2. Benefic Planets
Traditional astrology labels Venus and Jupiter as “benefic,” meaning they bring harmony, growth, and opportunities.

Jupiter = greater benefic → expansion, optimism

Venus = lesser benefic → love, beauty, relationships

Modern astrology doesn’t rigidly assign moral value; it’s about how energies are expressed in a chart.

3. Natural Ruler vs. Actual House Ruler
Natural ruler: The planet that “naturally” rules a house according to the zodiac (e.g., Mars rules Aries → 1st house).

Actual house ruler: Determined by the sign on the cusp of that house in your chart.

Energies of the natural ruler are expressed harmoniously in their house, but the actual ruler shows where and how the energy manifests uniquely in your life.

4. Neptune
A trans-Saturnian planet (along with Uranus and Pluto), associated with spirituality, mysticism, and the dissolution of boundaries.

Key qualities:

Inspiration, intuition, artistic creativity

Illusion, idealism, deception

Connection to the pituitary gland / third eye in modern astrology

Generational in influence (14 years per sign on average) but house placement and aspects make it personal.

Neptune’s effects can be subtle but profound, like water eroding rocks over time.

5. Cardinal Sins and Planetary Associations
There’s a traditional correspondence between sins (vices) and planets:

Sin	Planet	Virtue Counterpart
Pride	Sun	Humility
Sloth	Moon	Diligence
Envy	Mercury	Charity
Lust	Venus	Chastity
Wrath	Mars	Gentleness
Gluttony	Jupiter	Abstinence
Greed	Saturn	Poverty
Modern astrologers might interpret these more psychologically: the planet represents where we struggle and how to balance it.

6. Special Planetary Positions
Cazimi: Planet in the “heart of the Sun” (within ~17’ of arc). Extremely favorable placement, strengthening the planet.

Oriental planet: Planet east of the Sun, rising before it; associated with special skill, swiftness, or prominence in expression.

Out-of-bounds planet: Declination beyond the Sun’s maximum; often unconventional, independent, or original in behavior.

🔗 How it all connects
Think of a chart as a network of planetary energies, each with layers: sign, house, aspects, special status (OOB, oriental, cazimi).

The dominant planet is the thread that weaves the most meaning across all these layers.

Transpersonal planets like Neptune, Uranus, Pluto add depth beyond personal psychology—touching spiritual, creative, or generational themes.

Traditional correspondences (benefics/malefics, sins/virtues) give symbolic frameworks to understand strengths, challenges, and growth paths.

If you want, I can make a visual cheat sheet mapping all these planetary statuses, dominants, sins, virtues, and special placements into a single chart you can reference, which makes it super easy to see the patterns at a glance.

Do you want me to do that?

Outer Planets
Jump to navigationJump to search

Man trying to grasp the stars[1]
The outer planets are usually defined as those planets whose orbits around the Sun lie outside the earth's: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

Their opposite would be the Inner Planets such as Venus and Mercury.

The Outer planets are usually conceptualized as signifying generational shifts due to the fact that they stay in certain zodiacal signs and configurations for very long periods of time, and thus many people are born with them in similar positions in their birth charts.

In this sense, because Mars moves more quickly and relates more closely to individual life experience, some include Mars and perhaps Jupiter as an inner planet.[2]

This classification of the planets was popularized in the 20th century when Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were the outermost planetary bodies in the solar system. This was prior to the demotion of Pluto to the status of Dwarf Planet by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. Since that time astrologers have continued to use Pluto in the same way as they did prior to its demotion, and for the most part have continued to refer to it as a simply as a “planet.”

It is unclear how other recently discovered dwarf planets such as Eris will be classified by astrologers, although some have already begun investigating its astrological meaning.[3] Orbital Period
Jump to navigationJump to search

The planets' orbits[1]
The orbital period is the time required by a celestial body to complete a full 360° circle, relative to a point of reference.

The point of reference can, for example, be

the apparent position of the Sun (Synodic period)
the vernal equinox (Tropical period)
the nodes of an orbit (Draconitic period)
the pericenter of an orbit (Anomalistic period)
the Fixed Star background (Sidereal period)
The anomalistic periods of the important bodies in our solar system are:

Planet	Time	Notes
Moon	27.55 days	sidereal: 27.32 days. synodic: 29.53 days
Mercury	87.97 days	
Venus	224.70 days	
Earth	365.256 days	tropical: 365.242 days
Mars	686.98 days	1 year 322 days
Jupiter	11.869 years	11 years 317 days or 4334 days
Saturn	29.628 years	29 years 229 days
Uranus	84.665 years	84 years 243 days
Neptune	165.49 years	165 years 5-6 months
Pluto	247.7 years	uncertain. between 247.5 and 248 years Octave
Jump to navigationJump to search
The Octave refers to various concepts in astrology:

Cosmic Octave
The so-called Cosmic Octave was developed by Hans Cousto. He succeeded in making the Spherical Harmony, already studied by Johannes Kepler, audible to the human ear as Planetary Tone.

Higher Octave

The outer planets as the higher octave of the inner ones
Derived from the musical use of the term, "Octave" is seen as a kinship in the effects of celestial bodies.

With regard to the planets of the solar system, the following associations are assumed:

Uranus is considered the higher octave of Mercury, expressing that both planets describe mental-intellectual abilities, with Mercury relating more to concrete thinking and Uranus to intuition, flashes of insight, and innovations.
Neptune is regarded as the higher octave of Venus, indicating that Neptune is also associated with the theme of love, particularly altruistic love (Agape).
Pluto is often described as the higher octave of Mars, as it can also be associated with violence, especially the exercise of power and violence against masses, which are considered plutonic.
Regarding the Fixed Star, the term octave is primarily used by Johannes Vehlow.

Octave Planets of the Hamburg School
In the Hamburg School, the eight points of influence (hypothetical planets) are also seen as octave planets of real existing planets to describe their observed effects.

Cupido is considered the octave planet of Venus
Zeus is the octave planet of Uranus
Apollon is the octave planet of Jupiter
Admetos is the octave planet of Saturn
Vulkanus is the octave planet of Mars
Poseidon is the octave planet of Neptune
Pluto is seen, in contrast to other branches of astrology, as the octave planet of Mercury.  Combustion

Interpretation
In classical and horary astrology, this was considered to have a negative influence on the planet involved. Because of its principally small elongation (short distance from the sun), planet Mercury quite often gets "weakened" this way.

The negative connotation has largely disappeared from modern astrology in birth chart interpretation. Day Ruler

The Days of the Week in Chaldean Order
Synonym: Day Ruler

The seven Days of the Week each have a planet as their ruler, corresponding to the seven classical planetary gods. The names of the days in various European languages clearly indicate this. The order of the days can be traced back to the Chaldean Order.

The Day Ruler is always the ruler of the first Planetary Hour of the day's half, with the planets following in accordance with the Chaldean Order.

Since the determination of the days of the week is arbitrary and does not correspond to any current celestial positions, working with the Day Rulers is attributed to Trivial Astrology.

The "Detriment" is a term from Classical Astrology and represents the opposite of "Dignity".
It is sometimes referred to as "negative dignity".

Just like with dignities, a distinction is made between:

essential detriment (weakness)
accidental detriment (weakness)

The signs in parentheses indicate the rulership over the corresponding zodiac signs as it was customary before the discovery of the three trans-Saturnian planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, and as it corresponds to the Theme Mundi. Nowadays, they are still frequently used in Horary Astrology and Election, where the three trans-Saturnians are often not yet taken into account. Dignities
Jump to navigationJump to search
Synonym for the exaltation of a planet (Domicile).

When a planet is in the sign of its dignity, it is expressed in a way which closely resembles its inherent character.

The sign of a planet's dignity is always opposite the sign of its fall.

See also Dominance
Jump to navigationJump to search

Birth of Venus[1]
The question of which planet is strongest in a horoscope is an important one, and astrologers devised different methods to determine the dominant planet. The characteristics of dominant planets are prominent in the horoscope and have a powerful influence on the individual concerned.

Traditional western astrologers consider

Essential Dignities such as whether a planet is in the sign it rules or the sign of its Exaltation.
They also look at
Accidental Dignities, such as whether a planet is in an Angular House (the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house). Especially planets that are in the first half of an angular house (Angular Planets).
To some modern astrologers, dominant planets are those which form an

Aspect to either the Ascendant, Medium Coeli or both
The conjunction is regarded as being the most significant, followed by the opposition, square, trine and sextile. According to this scheme the planet which forms the most important aspects is considered to be the most dominant planet.
Some astrologers also consider that the following features indicate that a planet is dominant:

The most elevated planets (i.e. those found closest to the Medium Coeli)
Any planet which is conjunct a House Cusp
(Because house cusps vary with different house systems, the latter is probably least reliable) Domicile
Jump to navigationJump to search

The planets' domiciles
A sign of the zodiac in which a planet is the ruler. The qualities of this sign most closely resemble those of the ruling planet (for example, Mars and Aries).

The sign situated opposite the domicile is the planet's detriment. If a planet is in its detriment the sign modifies the planets' qualities in ways that seem diametrically opposed to its innate nature (i.e. agressive Mars in peace-loving Libra).

A planet in the sign of its exaltation (e.g. Mars in Capricorn) is supposedly well-situated, in that the sign possesses similar qualities to the planet in question. A planet situated in the opposing sign is in a state of fall (i.e. Mars in Cancer). This status is similar to detriment in that the sign is seen as possessing qualities that are in many ways foreign to the planet in question, and that inhibit the planet's effective operation.

Interpretation
This kind of categorisation can easily lead to the idea that a planet in a particular sign of the zodiac is somehow 'bad' or 'good'. Consequently it is largely obsolete in modern psychological astrology.
Classical and horary astrology, however, still make use of these categories to visualise which planets are "stronger" or "weaker" in judging the expected outcome of a question or an event. Diurnal Motion

The sun, moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. Owing to their relatively short orbital periods, these planets can be in different signs of the zodiac in the charts of individuals born in the same year or even the same month - for example, the moon changes signs every 2 1/2 days.

They contribute a highly individualistic character to each birth chart. They represent the following themes of a personal nature:

Personal consciousness or sense of identity (sun)
Emotions (moon)
Communicative abilities and learning capacity (Mercury)
Aesthetic sense and relationships (Venus)
Assertiveness (Mars)
The personal planets are distinguished from the social planets (Jupiter and Saturn) which can spend one to 2.5 years in a sign or house; and spiritual or generational planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto). These spend so long in one sign that they can typify a whole generation of people.  Planet

Explanations of the symbols
An ancient Greek term meaning wandering star - as opposed to the backdrop of the fixed stars.

This term has different meanings in astronomy and astrology:

Astronomy
The two meanings started diverging after the Copernican revolution, which placed the sun at the center of our solar system and the term planet started to indicate a celestial body directly orbiting the sun. Planets reflect the sun's light, rather than being luminous themselves, and circle it along elliptical orbits. Their orbital period is determined by their distance from the sun: the further away they are, the longer their orbital period.

Numerous new celestial bodies have been discovered in our solar system since the beginning of the 19th century (asteroids, centaurs, the Kuiper Belt and many new discoveries can be expected in the future,) but very few added to the count of known planets, the others being classified as either dwarf planets or comets.

Until 2006 astronomers counted nine planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.

Only Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are normally visible from the earth with the naked eye. Although Uranus is occasionally visible unaided under ideal viewing conditions, and astronomer John Flamsteed classified it as a fixed star in 1691, William Herschel first noted its movement one century later. Galileo first observed Neptune in 1612, but thought it io be a moon of Jupiter. Neptune was classified as a planet in 1846. Pluto awaited discovery as a planet until 1930. Consequently the moon, sun, and the original "naked eye" planets were the only ones known to ancient cultures and traditional astrologers.

Mercury and Venus are classified as inner planets because they orbit the sun within the earth's own orbit
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are classified astronomically as outer planets, with orbits outside of the earth's orbit
Mercury, Venus, earth and Mars are similar in structure and size; Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are classified as giant planets
Pluto is the only ice planet
Mercury, Venus and Mars all have smaller masses than the Earth, and the giant planets all have considerably larger masses. Jupiter's mass is 318 times that of the Earth, and Saturn's is 95 times as large. Pluto has the smallest mass of all nine planets. All planets apart from Mercury and Venus have at least one moon.

In 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) introduced a new definition of planet, as a celestial body orbiting the sun that is large enough to be "round" and that does not share its orbit with other celestial bodies unless they are satellites. This definition does not hold for Pluto, so they reclassified it as a dwarf planet. Thus the count of known planets in our solar system is currently eight.

Astrology

Astrology classifies the moon as a planet but not the earth[1]
Astrology classifies the planets differently than astronomy because its focus is different. Astrologers normally see the planets from a geocentric or earth-based perspective, rather than a heliocentric one, and keep the classical definition of "wandering star".

The sun and moon are counted as planets but normally the earth is not included because it is the location of the astrologer and horoscope native. Therefore, the seven classical planets in astrology are: sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Most modern astrologers also work with Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto for a total of ten planets.

These planets are divided into three groups: personal, social and spiritual or outer planets. The latter are Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, the social planets are Jupiter and Saturn and the five remaining planets are classified as personal planets. Astronomers' reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006 has not affected its status in modern astrology.

Some astrologers include additional celestial bodies in their work: the dwarf planet Ceres; major asteroids Pallas, Juno and Vesta; and the centaur Chiron enjoy increasing popularity.

All the planets except the sun and the moon are named after the Roman gods of Antiquity. Many astrologers attach significance to the myths associated with these gods. Of the seven classical planets the moon, Venus and sometimes Saturn were considered to be feminine; the sun, Mars, and Jupiter masculine; and Mercury hermaphroditic.

The planets, zodiac signs, aspects between planets, and houses form the basis for most astrological interpretation. The planets represent archetypal energies in humans which are additionally coloured by their position in the signs. The house position indicates the area of life in which these energies will be most strongly expressed.

Astrologers disagree about which model best explains the way astrology works: whether the planets have some kind of direct physical influence (causality) or whether they are only indicators (in the way that the hands of a clock indicate the time without actually causing it) and operate by analogy in a more holistic model.

The following table summarizes the meaning of each planet's function in a birth chart. More details can be found under the headings of individual planets.

Ascending Venus and Mars, as well as descending Saturn nodes

Inclination of Jupiter's orbit to the ecliptic[1]
The term Planet Nodes refers to the intersection points of planetary orbits with the Ecliptic, similar to the Lunar Nodes. Just like with the lunar nodes, there are ascending (northern) and descending (southern) nodes. At the ascending node, the planet crosses the ecliptic towards the celestial north pole (i.e., it then has a positive Declination), while at the descending node, it is the opposite.[2]
Already Dane Rudhyar addressed the topic in 1950 in his Astrology of Personality.[3]

Calculation and Position
The lunar nodes describe a more or less constant path through the Zodiac. For the planetary nodes, this is not the case, at least from an earthly perspective (geocentric). Since the Planets orbit the Sun rather than the Earth like the Moon, a distinction is made between the heliocentric and geocentric positions when determining the planetary nodes. From a heliocentric perspective, the planetary nodes traverse the zodiac just like the lunar node at a uniform speed, but much slower, namely only between 30' and 72' in a hundred years. Thus, they are practically stationary heliocentrically.
Geocentrically - their currently common consideration - the planetary nodes can be located at different points in the zodiac over the course of a year; however, the range of possible positions decreases with increasing distance of the planet from the Sun; only for the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) do the nodes completely traverse the zodiac.

Graphical Ephemeris of the Geocentric Nodes in 2010 (to be read from inside to outside; valid for a century, the nodes are practically at the same position each year due to their slow heliocentric movement).

Node Days
For Mundane Astrology, it is interesting that the "Node Days" - which remain fairly constant within a century - can be those days when the nodes of a planet are stationary (see also the Graphical Ephemeris above), or are in exact opposition to each other (for the inner planets in conjunction), i.e., when the Sun is exactly at the heliocentric node positions or "axes" (Bonin).
Overview of the Critical Node Days, Degrees, or "Node Axes" (1950; practically valid for the entire twentieth century):

Planet	Day (approx.)[4]	Degree	Day (approx.)	Degree
Jupiter (Opp.)	1.1.	10.0°Cap.gif	2.7.	10.0°Can.gif
Pluto (Opp.)	10.1.	19.7°Cap.gif	12.7.	19.7°Can.gif
Saturn (Opp.)	14.1.	23.2°Cap.gif	16.7.	23.2°Can.gif
Neptune (Opp.)	31.1.	11.2°Aqu.gif	4.8.	11.2°Leo.gif
Mercury (Conj.)	8.5.	17.7°Tau.gif	10.11.	17.7°Sco.gif
Mars (Opp.)	10.5.	19.2°Tau.gif	12.11.	19.2°Sco.gif
Uranus (Opp.)	5.6.	13.7°Gem.gif	6.12.	13.8°Sag.gif
Venus (Conj.)	7.6.	16.2°Gem.gif	8.12.	16.2°Sag.gif
Thus, the days around 9.5. and 11.11. are virtually Mars-Mercury Days - when a Mercury node conjunction and a Mars node opposition occur simultaneously.[5]
The days around 6.6. and 7.12. fall under Venus-Uranus, as a Venus node conjunction and a Uranus node opposition occur in parallel.

Example Node Horoscope

Thomas Gottschalk with the nodes
In Thomas Gottschalk's node horoscope, the conjunction of the descending Mercury node with the ascending Venus node is particularly striking - all of this in a square to the radix Jupiter - which explains his jovial, sociable nature. Furthermore, his Sun is in conjunction with the ascending Mercury node, his Moon is in conjunction with the ascending Uranus node (= his "vivacity" and emotional freshness), Mercury is in conjunction with the ascending Mars node (= his verbal "sharpness"), and Uranus is in conjunction with the ascending Jupiter node (a success configuration); and not least his descending Mars node (trine Jupiter) in one - all points that would not be easily visible in the regular birth chart.

Karmic Indicators?
The planetary nodes could - especially in horoscope comparison, similar to the lunar nodes - indicate karmic relationships, points of connection, or entanglements from past lives.[7]


Horoscopes with the nodes show a high information density[8]
Critical Assessment
The interpretation of a node is usually similar to that of the associated planet (plus the additional emphasis on "connection" (north node) or "detachment" (south node) with/from a planetary energy.
Tony Bonin practically does not differentiate the nodes from the respective planets - which is somewhat undifferentiated.
Further interpretative factors in astrology always bring the advantage of gaining information; but also the disadvantage of a certain lack of clarity or an - also visual - overload of the horoscope.
Incorporating many new horoscope elements carries the risk of a kind of arbitrariness or randomness in interpretation - i.e., finding what is sought in a marginal corner of the horoscope...
Unfortunately, only a few astrology programs can calculate and display the planetary nodes.
Even at Astrodienst, calculation is currently only possible in test mode.
ChatGPT said:
Wow, that’s a dense, mega-deep dive into astrology, and it covers everything from classical planetary rulerships to modern node interpretations. Let me break it down for clarity and highlight the core concepts—so you’re not swimming in info overload. I’ll also connect it to practical use if you were reading a chart.

1. Outer vs. Inner Planets
Inner (Personal) Planets: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars

Move relatively quickly, so they affect personal identity and daily experiences.

Themes: identity, emotions, communication, relationships, drive.

Social Planets: Jupiter, Saturn

Move slowly (1–2.5 years per sign), influencing societal or generational trends.

Outer (Transpersonal/Spiritual) Planets: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto

Move very slowly (decades to centuries), shaping generational shifts, collective consciousness, and spiritual evolution.

Pluto still counts in astrology despite its dwarf planet status.

Takeaway: Inner planets = personal story; outer planets = bigger societal or karmic story.

2. Planetary “Octaves”
Idea: outer planets are higher-frequency expressions of inner planets.

Uranus → Mercury (mental abilities, intuition, innovation)

Neptune → Venus (love, compassion, spiritual connection)

Pluto → Mars (power, transformation, deep drive)

The Hamburg School even has hypothetical “octave planets,” but that’s more niche.

3. Dignities, Exaltations, Fall, Detriment
Domicile: Planet is in its home sign → strongest, truest expression

Detriment: Planet is opposite its home → challenged expression

Exaltation: Planet in a sign that enhances it → elevated expression

Fall: Opposite its exaltation → weakened expression

Modern perspective: Mainly used for psychological or horary astrology. Less judgmental than classical, which sometimes called planets “good” or “bad.”

4. Combustion
Planet too close to the Sun (≤8.5°) → historically weakened

Mercury is the classic example (“burned by the Sun”)

Today, mostly symbolic rather than literal negative effect.

5. Planetary Nodes
Like lunar nodes but for all planets, showing points of intersection with the ecliptic.

Ascending node: “connection” → pull toward planetary energy

Descending node: “detachment” → lessons or karmic release

Example of planetary node interpretation:

Mercury Node → networking, ideas, communication

Venus Node → union, harmony, creative partnerships

Mars Node → energy, conflict, collaboration

Jupiter Node → growth, cooperation

Saturn Node → structure, bonds, limitations

Uranus Node → innovation, sudden change

Neptune Node → mysticism, idealism, platonic connection

Pluto Node → power, deep transformation, karmic pressure

Lunar nodes = more personal, karmic/family-oriented.

6. Day Rulers
Each day of the week ruled by a planet (Chaldean Order).

Example: Monday → Moon, Tuesday → Mars, etc.

Mostly symbolic now, but historically tied to planetary hours and daily influences.

7. Motion & Orbital Periods
Inner planets move fast (days to months), outer planets slow (years to centuries)

Retrograde motion, angular placement, and stationing affect their strength and influence in a chart.

8. Practical Astrology Use
Inner planets: focus on personal growth, emotions, relationships.

Outer planets: generational or karmic patterns, spiritual lessons.

Nodes: where energy is being learned or released.

Dignities/Exaltations: show how easily a planet expresses itself.

Day rulers: ritual or daily timing symbolism.

If you want, I can make a visual cheat sheet connecting each planet, its node, dignity, exaltation, fall, and octave so you can see it all at a glance. It’ll turn this encyclopedia into something your brain can actually use.

Do you want me to do that?

Planet Tone
Jump to navigationJump to search

Kepler's assignment of planets to tones or sequences of tones[1]
Synonyms: Cosmic Tone; Cosmic Octave

The sun sounds in ancient ways
In brotherly spheres' contest of song,
And its prescribed journey
It completes with thunderous sound.
(Goethe, Faust I - Prologue in Heaven)
The planetary tone refers to the assignment of specific tones or frequencies to individual planets. This idea is very old but has experienced a resurgence in modern times, particularly in the esoteric field.

History

The planets assigned to tones in the music of the spheres by Gaffurius, 1496
According to the biblical verse from the Book of Wisdom "You have ordered all things according to measure, number, and weight" (Wisdom 11:20[2]), spiritual astrology - in the tradition of the Pythagoreans - assigns the seven tones of the scale to the classical planets in the following order:

c = Venus
d = Moon
e = Saturn
f = Jupiter
g = Mars
a = Sun
h = Mercury
Plato also assumed (in his dialogues Republic and Timaeus) eight tones that originated from the seven planetary spheres and the sphere of fixed stars. Physically/acoustically, ordinary mortals could not perceive the fine celestial tones. Nevertheless, this so-called "harmony of the spheres" was of great importance for medieval music theory.

Since the system is based on the geocentric worldview, no specific tone could be assigned to the Earth as its assumed center.

Planetary Tones According to Cousto
Hans Cousto, a Swiss mathematician and music researcher, redefined the planetary tones in 1978. His tones are based on actual frequencies, mostly orbital periods, but also other continuously repeating astronomical rhythms. These are very long wavelengths that are naturally inaudible to the human ear. To derive audible tones from them, the respective frequency length is halved repeatedly (i.e., the frequency itself is doubled) until it falls within the pleasant hearing range of the human ear. Musically, this process is referred to as "octavation," as the musical octave is also based on frequency doubling. The calculation basis is the duration of the original frequency in seconds.[3]

Joachim-Ernst Berendt used Cousto's method of octavation, i.e., the transposition or multiple doubling of the orbital/rotational frequencies of the Earth and the planets as the basis for his widely distributed audio production "Planetary Tones." The composer Steve Schroyder also developed corresponding music with Cousto's involvement. Cousto himself has software called MidiPlanetarium for this purpose.

Criticism
The following objection must be raised: Unlike Johannes Kepler, Hans Kayser, Rudolf Haase, Peter Neubäcker, and other harmonic researchers, Cousto does not use (relative) intervals or chords, but absolute frequencies. Planetary Motion
Jump to navigationJump to search

The stationary period, direct and retrograde motion of Mars
Planetary motion (speed, velocity) is a measure of how quickly a planet appears to move through the heavens, and how long it takes the planet to complete its orbit cycle. The moon is the fastest-moving planet, followed by Mercury, Venus and the sun. The distance in degrees traveled by a planet on a given day can be tracked on an ephemeris. The speed of a planet is a function of how quickly it travels, but also of the length of its orbit. The moon completes its orbit around the earth in 29.5 days, whereas Saturn requires about 29.5 years to complete its orbit around the sun.

Determining a planet’s motion or speed is used in predictive and electional astrology to time events; for example, when one planet will aspect another or move into a new house. It is especially important in horary astrology to determine whether or when a given event is likely to take place.


Retrograde motion of Mars 2003.
A horary chart may appear to represent the moment of the question, frozen in time; but its interpretation depends upon a dynamic reading of whether the important planets create applying or separating aspects, which is a function of how quickly the planets travel. Perhaps a desired aspect will never form exactly, because the faster-moving planet pulls away from the slower planet; or plans are foiled because a third planet catches up to the two and intervenes with its own conjunction or stressful aspect.

Planets have an average daily motion, but actual speeds can vary on a given day, notably as a planet turns stationary and moves between direct and retrograde motion, so it is best to check an ephemeris to determine planetary motion for a given chart. Planetary Tone

Spiritual astrology associates the seven classical planets with the seven standard notes of the musical scale:

c = Venus
d = Moon
e = Saturn
f = Jupiter
g = Mars
a = Sun
h = Mercury
Taken together the planets form the harmony of spheres which was of great significance for music in the Middle Ages - although their tones are inaudible on Earth.
In recent times, Joachim-Ernst Berendt has studied these cosmic tones. Pluto

Astronomy
Planets in astrology are categorized differently than in astronomy. Although the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006 (and therefore on a par with Ceres and Eris) to modern astrologers Pluto is still a full planet, and a powerful one, at that.

Astrological Pluto is the most distant planet from the sun in our solar system. It was discovered by Clyde William Tonbaugh on the 18th February, 1930, at the Lowell observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Percival Lowell was an American businessman, traveler, and astronomer who predicted the existence of a further planet beyond Neptune after extensive research several years earlier. Pluto was named as a result of a suggestion by 11-year-old Miss Venetia Burney, of Oxford. (Walt Disney’s dog, by the way, was in 1931 named after the planet, not the other way round.)

Pluto is comparatively small, with an equatorial diameter of 2370 km, 18.5% that of Earth's, while its biggest moon Charon has a diameter of 1208 km, 9.5% that of Earth's.[2] Its mean density is 1.86 g/ cm³. It has an average distance from the Sun of 5960 million km, and an eccentric elliptical orbit of 248 years which is also highly inclined relative to the ecliptic; and therefore to the orbits of the other planets. Pluto's orbit sometimes even takes it inside the orbit of Neptune. Its average diurnal movement is 15 seconds of arc, with a maximum of 2.5 minutes of arc.

Mythology
The Greek god Hades (Latin Pluto) was the ruler of the underworld, the kingdom of the dead, as well as of the riches that lie under the earth. After he and his brothers defeated their father Cronos (Saturn) they divided the world among themselves. Zeus (Jupiter) became ruler of the heavens; and Poseidon (Neptune) ruler of the seas. Hades' kingdom was especially feared. The Greeks believed that people lived on as shadows of their former existence and that they continued to unconsciously carry out tasks that they had previously done on earth. Hermes (Mercury) accompanied the dead across the river Styx which marked the edge of the conscious world. The other side was guarded by Cerberus, the hound of hell which prevented anyone who had entered the underworld from leaving it. Apart from Mercury, only a select few were ever allowed to leave the underworld after descending into it, including Heracles, Odysseus and Psyche. For mortals the world of Hades was a kingdom of no return.

Liz Greene[3]: Long before the concept of a Christian afterlife there existed the myth of an underworld, governed by a stern ruler of the dead, to which the souls of both good and evil journeyed. In the myths of Sumeria and Babylon, this impenetrable domain was the territory of a female deity called Ereshkigal, for our final abode was perceived as the same dark womb from which we emerged to take our place in earthly incarnation.

In early Greek myth, the underworld was haunted by terrifying goddesses such as the Moire or Fates, Hekate, the mistress of sorcery, and the Erinyes, goddesses of vengeance. But just as the sea eventually became the domain of the male deity, Poseidon, the underworld passed into the hands of the enigmatic god, Hades. The Romans knew him as Pluto, from the Greek meaning "giver of wealth."

Invisible to the eyes of mortals, Pluto could be obsessive and violent. Yet he was inexorably just in his fashion. Guarded by a ferocious three-headed dog, his realm encompassed the calm restfulness of the Elysian Fields, abode of dead heroes, and the torture chambers of Tartaros, reserved for those who had in their lifetimes offended the gods. So immovable was the will of Pluto that, once a soul had passed into the underworld, no dictate from any other god could bring it back again, for the irrevocability of death has precedence over every other divine command.

Yet Pluto could also be immensely seductive, and his charms are portrayed in myth by his tempting of Persephone with the sweetness of the pomegranate. Because death was understood to be an impenetrable mystery, few images of Pluto have survived from antiquity. Nor are there any temples to the Lord of the Dead, for his presence is everywhere: his altars exist in the mortal bodies of all living things.


Persephone and Hades[4]
Because the figure of Pluto was more feared than revered, he is a relatively rare figure in the worship of ancient Greece. The best-known of myths of Hades concern his wife Persephone (Proserpine), daughter of Demeter (Ceres), the goddess of agricultural fertility. This myth has several different versions, but was central to Greek religion in the form of the Eleusinian Mysteries dedicated to the goddess Demeter.

Essentially the story concerns the abduction of Demeter's daughter Persephone by Hades, who takes the girl to the underworld, consummates his passion, and makes her his queen. Persephone fasts as a means of showing her distress at this treatment. Demeter meanwhile frantically searches for her missing daughter, only to learn of the abduction. Demeter asks Zeus, in his capacity as supreme ruler of the gods, to order Hades to release the girl, but Zeus declines. In grief and retaliation, Demeter causes a massive drought that makes all plants on Earth wither. Zeus, fearing that there would soon be no more humans left to bring him sacrifices, finally commands his brother to return Persephone, provided she has eaten nothing underground. Before Hades releases Persephone, however, he tricks her into eating some pomegranate seeds, a symbol of female fertility. The gods broker a compromise, in which Perspehone would spend two thirds of the year on earth and one third with her husband in the underworld. Although the couple produce no children, Persephone gains considerable power as the goddess of the underworld as well as the symbol of nature's annual regeneration.

Since the time of the ancient Greeks, this myth has been interpreted on several levels: as a symbol of the seasonal agricultural cycle, as a metaphor for the soul's descent to earth and return to heaven, and as the light and shadow of human consciousness.

Rulerships
Pluto is the modern ruler of Scorpio. Mars is the traditional ruler.

Because of its association with Scorpio, to which medical astrology assigns the reproductive and eliminative functions of the body, modern astrologers assign sexuality and elimination to Pluto, as well. Pluto is also the modern ruler of things similar to these processes, and to the god Hades in mythology, such as abductions, rape, cemeteries, and the dead. Furthermore, Pluto is the modern ruler of radioactive substances.

Interpretation
Pluto, Uranus and Neptune are the so-called generational or spiritual planets which point to a realm beyond the limits of the material world symbolised by Saturn. Pluto in particular touches on a realm of being that most people find deeply disturbing. The time of its discovery (1930) was also a time marked by the rise of National Socialism and the discovery of nuclear fission (1938). For this reason, Pluto is associated with mass movements and processes of transformation that lead to deep changes on a collective level.

Pluto stands not only for crises but for the process of long suppressed or forbidden things coming to light which is a prerequisite for healing and becoming whole. Pluto is the symbol for transformation in the sense of a far reaching metamorphosis which can release powerful and archaic energies in a way most people would never have thought possible. Whether these energies are used to serve society or to further self-interests is another question.

Pluto themes are power and powerlessness, domination, dependence that can lead to emotional entanglement, sexuality and taboo subjects. In the best sense Pluto stands for personal transformation through getting to the core of a matter, releasing outworn habits, and enormous powers of healing. Pluto also points to collective necessities to which individuals must yield.

Its long orbital period means that Pluto is in the same sign of the zodiac for a whole generation. Due to its highly elliptical orbit this can vary from 12 to 32 years. For this reason, Pluto's house position and any aspects to personal planets are more important than its position by sign in an individual's horoscope. The house position indicates the area of life in which an individual will undergo deep transformational processes, but also where they have access to great inner riches. It shows where they will be confronted with the themes of power and dependency, too.


Pluto's Abduction of Proserpine on a Unicorn[5]
Aspects between Pluto and slow-moving outer planets are generational, such as the longstanding Pluto-Neptune sextile that affects post World War II births.

When Pluto is in aspect with another planet or axis or in transit, it intensifies and deepens these horoscope factors, involving them in processes of death and rebirth which can lead to transformation of the themes associated with the horoscope factors. This process is often very painful because it requires relinquishing something which has outlived its usefulness and becomes obsolete. In the end, this can be a healing process that leads to a greater degree of wholeness. Primary ruler

Astronomy
The Earth is the closest planet to the Sun after Mercury and Venus. Its diameter at the equator is 12'756 kilometres, and the average distance to the Sun is 149,6 million kilometres. It has an orbital period of 365 days, 5 hours and 49 minutes, and requires 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds for one axial rotation.

Mythology
Greek and Roman Mother Earth goddesses diverged somewhat. Although the Romans adopted the primal Greek earth goddess Gaia, they continued to worship their own goddess Tellus or Tellus Mater. Tellus particularly symbolized land for cultivation and the earth as the resting place of the dead.


Tellus, the Roman earth goddess, shown with Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome
Gaia, the Greek earth goddess, was the first deity to emerge out of the primordial chaos. Gaia represented the reproductive potential of the earth. She brought forth Uranus, the starry sky; the sea, and the mountains. She united with Uranus and bore, among others, Cyclops, three hundred-armed giants as well as the Titans, including Kronos (Latin: Saturn) and Rhea. Because Uranus rejected most of his children and feared that they would overthrow him, he kept them imprisoned in the depths of the earth. This deeply hurt Gaia who gave Kronos a sickle with which to castrate Uranus and free herself.

Gaia tended to take sides when the gods disputed amongst themselves and often took up an opposing position to Zeus who was king of the gods.

Interpretation
The earth as a separate planet has little astrological significance because it is the position of the observer in astrology's usual geocentric world view. The earth is represented in the geocentric chart by the ascendant and descendant axis, which show the points of the rising and setting sun on the horizon. The Imum Coeli shows the lowest point of the sun's passage "under" the earth.

The heliocentric model, seldom used in astrology, does put the sun as the observer's position, and consequently a heliocentric horoscope shows the earth as a separate planet. However, its position is always 180 degrees opposite the sun's position in the geocentric chart.

Because astrologers seldom treat the earth as a planet in the usual sense, it has no rulerships, dignities, or affiliations. Some astrologers consider the earth to be a good match with Taurus, based on its affinity with this fixed earth sign. Essential Dignities
Jump to navigationJump to search

Dignities and Debilities of the Planets
In Traditional Astrology planets have essential dignity if they are in the sign of their Rulership or Domicile, the sign of their Exaltation, Triplicity, Term, or Face or in specific degrees of other signs where they function well.

A dignified planet is stronger than one lacking in essential dignity.

Essential dignity refers to the relative strength or weakness of a planet or point's zodiac position by sign and degree, or its essence - what the 17th-century astrologer William Lilly called "the strength, fortitude or debility of the Planets [or] significators." In other words, essential dignity seeks to view the strengths of a planet or point as though it were isolated from other factors in the sky of the Natal Chart.

By comparison, Accidental Dignities indicate how much strength a planet or point derives from its position in a natal chart, such as its relation to the other factors in the chart: for example, its proximity to other planets, or to the four Angles of the chart, or to stars, as well as the Aspects (or symmetrical angular connections) it forms with other planets or points in the chart.

For example, the essential dignity of Mars, if located at 27 degrees of Capricorn would take into account the fact that Mars is exalted in Capricorn, and also that it is the "bounds" ruler of the 27th degree of Capricorn and also the face ruler of the 27th degree of Capricorn. This is a considerably dignified Mars.

If that Mars were located in the twelfth house of a natal chart, Mars's accidental dignity would be poor, since it would be located in a weak or malevolent Cadent House. If Mars was also squared to a malevolent planet, such as Saturn, and would be receiving a dexter Square Aspect from malefic Saturn, ruler of Capricorn, this would further hinder Mars's strength and ability to operate benevolently. These accidental dignity factors would tend to weaken a Mars which is otherwise strong in essential dignity.

Traditionally the five essential dignities are:

Domicile (rulership or house) + Detriment
Exaltation + Fall
Triplicity
Terms (or "Bounds")
Face (or Decan)
For post-Classical astrologers, such as Guido Bonatti or Lilly, the dignities had a hierarchy. The most important dignity was domicile rulership; slightly less important was exaltation. Triplicity rulerships were still fairly important in medieval astrology, but nowhere near as vital as they were for Hellenistic astrologers such as Ptolemy. Terms or bounds rulerships became very much diminished in importance, and face rulers were almost entirely ignored. Lilly said that the only function face rulers served was to keep a planet from being entirely peregrine; that is, without any essential dignity whatever — which was considered a malefic condition.

However, Hellenistic astrologers had a very different view of the dignities. To earlier astrologers, such as Ptolemy and Vettius Valens, domicile rulership, exaltation, triplicity rulership and bounds rulership were all of equal strength in influence.

Many modern astrologers take little heed of essential dignities, with the exception of domicile rulerships. This is most likely the result of the simplification of astrological technique that occurred when astrology lost popularity beginning in the eighteenth century.

Modern dignities
Many modern astrologers, eschewing the use of the other essential dignities, use the three outer planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto as the modern rulers of Aquarius, Pisces and Scorpio, respectively. The practice derives from the similarity between the nature of the planets with the nature of these signs. This as illustrated by the differences in the two "decans" tables above. It has also included more recently the dwarf planets Ceres and Eris relating them to Virgo and Libra, the same as the signs Scorpio, Aquarius and Pisces.

ChatGPT said:
Wow, you’ve dumped a full-on cosmic encyclopedia here! Let’s unpack this in a way that ties all these threads together—planetary tones, Pluto, Earth, and essential dignities—without drowning in tables.

Planetary Tones
Ancient thought (Pythagoreans, Plato, medieval theorists) tied musical notes to planets—the “harmony of the spheres.” The classical scale was mapped to the seven traditional planets like this:

C = Venus, D = Moon, E = Saturn, F = Jupiter, G = Mars, A = Sun, H = Mercury

These tones weren’t audible to humans; they symbolized cosmic order and harmony. Think of it as the universe “singing” mathematically rather than literally.

Modern take: Hans Cousto (1978)

Uses actual orbital periods/frequencies of planets, then “octavates” them (doubling/halving frequencies) into the audible range.

Each planet now has a sound signature corresponding to its spiritual or psychological principle:

Mercury → communication/intellect

Venus → love/harmony

Mars → willpower/action

Jupiter → creativity/expansion

Saturn → concentration/discipline

Uranus → surprise/innovation

Neptune → intuition/dreams

Pluto → deep transformation and integration

These frequencies are even used in meditation, sound bowls, and cosmic music.

Pluto
Astronomically a dwarf planet, but astrologically still a full-power transformational planet.

Themes: death/rebirth, hidden power, taboo, sexuality, deep healing, collective transformation.

Mythologically, Pluto (Hades) rules the underworld and wealth beneath the Earth. The Persephone myth illustrates cycles of descent, transformation, and return.

Astrological note: Pluto rules Scorpio in modern astrology, highlighting transformative processes, obsessions, and regenerative power.

Earth
In astrology, the Earth is usually the observer, not the observed. Its position is mirrored by the Sun’s placement.

Earth carries Taurus-like energy, symbolizing grounding, cultivation, and stability.

Mythologically, Gaia/Tellus represents fertility, life, and the material grounding of all things.

Essential Dignities
Domicile / Rulership: Planet in the sign it naturally rules → strong expression.

Exaltation: Planet expresses its qualities harmoniously, though in a more refined way.

Triplicity, Terms, Face: Secondary levels of planetary strength.

Detriment / Fall: Planet in a sign opposite its rulership/exaltation → challenged expression.

Modern twist: Outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) have affined rulerships over Aquarius, Pisces, Scorpio, respectively, aligning their archetypal energies to signs.

Putting it Together
You can imagine the planetary tones + dignities + mythology as a multidimensional language for understanding the cosmos:

Pluto’s “tone” is deep, transformative—its musical vibration mirrors its astrological archetype.

Earth’s grounding presence allows us to perceive and interact with these vibrations in the material world.

Dignities show how comfortably a planet can “sing its song” in any given sign or chart placement.

So, if you were to make a “soundtrack of your natal chart”, you could literally play Cousto tones of each planet, with intensity or volume modulated by essential dignity. Scorpio with Pluto in domicile? Deep, resonant, transformative tones. Saturn exalted? Crisp, structured, disciplined harmonics.

If you want, I can make a chart linking every planet, its Cousto tone, essential dignity, and archetypal theme—basically a cosmic audio-map of astrology. It would let you “hear” a chart, not just read it.

Do you want me to do that?

Exaltation
Jump to navigationJump to search

Joys and Exaltations in the Thema Mundi[1]
The term is derived from the Greek Synonym hypsoma (ὕψωμα), which means “to raise up” or “exalt” something.

A type of essential Dignity.

The qualities of a planet and its sign of exaltation are similar, so that when a planet is in its sign of exaltation it is thought to express its inherent qualities in a particularly 'pure' form.

Modern astrologers do not agree on signs for exaltations of the "newly discovered" planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, so the exaltations are usually restricted to the seven traditional planets.

A planet's sign of exaltation is always located opposite the sign of the same planet's Fall.

Saturn is exalted in Libra.

Jupiter is exalted in Cancer.

Mars is exalted in Capricorn.

Venus is exalted in Pisces.

Mercury is exalted in Virgo.

The Moon is exalted in Taurus.

The Sun is exalted in Aries.
According to the 7th century astrologer Rhetorius of Egypt, the exaltations are auspicious placements for the planets because the Domicile lord of that sign interacts particularly well with the planet that has its exaltation in the sign. In some traditions there are specific degrees associated with the exaltations. According to the Hellenistic sources, the degrees of exaltation are as follows:[2]


Exaltation Degrees of the Planets
Saturn is exalted in the 21st degree of Libra.

Jupiter is exalted in the 15th degree of Cancer.

Mars is exalted in the 28th degree of Capricorn.

Venus is exalted in the 27th degree of Pisces.

Mercury is exalted in the 15th degree of Virgo.

The Moon is exalted in the 3rd degree of Taurus.

The Sun is exalted in the 19th degree of Aries.

The sign that is opposite to a planet’s exaltation is known as its Fall or Depression. Retrograde Motion

Astronomy
The sun and moon do not have this effect of backwards or retrograde motion, but the other planets all go through phases of retrograde motion, as viewed from the earth. In astronomical reality, the planets do continue to move in the same direction, anticlockwise around the sun.

Mercury and Venus, the only two planets which orbit the sun inside the earth's own orbit, are retrograde when they appear to be in front of the sun from a geocentric perspective (Their motion is direct when they are behind the sun.) Although Mercury and Venus appear to move faster than the sun, by turning retrograde periodically, they always stay within one or two signs of the sun. Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, whose orbits all lie outside the earth's own orbit, appear to turn retrograde during periods in which the earth is moving more quickly than they are. This occurs when they form an opposition to the sun.

In ephemerides planets in retrograde motion have an "R" printed next to them.

Before a planet changes its direction from either retrograde to direct or vice versa its motion becomes increasingly slower until it appears to come to a stop. This is called the stationary phase.

The planets have different periods of retrograde motion[2]:

Mercury 3 times a year for 3 weeks, 19.2% of the time
Venus roughly every 18 months for 40 to 44 days, 7.3% of the time
Mars roughly every 26 months for 60 to 80 days, 9.5% of the time
Jupiter roughly every 13 months for about 4 months, 30.4% of the time
Saturn roughly every 12 1/2 months for about 4 1/2 months, 36.6% of the time
Uranus roughly every 12 months for about 5 months, 41.2% of the time
Neptune roughly every 12 months for 5 months and 6 days, 43.1% of the time
Pluto roughly every 12 months for 5 to 6 months, 43.4% of the time
Chiron is stationary 5.1%, and retrograde 39.7% of the time

Interpretation
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are retrograde for nearly half the year. They are very common in horoscopes, to the point where they probably need no special interpretation, as so many people have them.

The core meaning of a retrograde planet is that its basic energies are turned inward. A retrograde planet can therefore be beneficial in encouraging people with natal retrogrades to be introspective. At the same time, the person may find it difficult to express the retrograde planet's basic nature in an outward, straightforward way. For example, a person with natal Mercury retrograde may become a deep thinker, while simultaneously having difficulty in expressing his ideas in a logical fashion. Saturn can show where and how a person feels inadequate or frustrated, but with Saturn opposite the sun, Saturn will be retrograde, heightening self-esteem issues, as Saturn's natural critical proclivities are turned inward.

To put it shortly: Especially a retrograde Mercury is usually a good time for things that start with "re", such as reviewing, reassessing, redoing, renovating, repairing, rebuilding, relaxing, recovering, reflecting, renewing, retreating, revisiting, reconciling, rewording, recollecting, recycling, refinishing, recuperating etc.
A retrograde planet can turn direct, or a direct planet can turn retrograde by secondary progression. The retrograde Mercury or Venus in a natal chart will usually turn direct at some time during the course of a person's life, making it easier to express their energies in a direct manner.

A retrograde planet in the natal chart has already passed over its natal position before the birth took place. For this reason retrograde planets can indicate something that a person may feel familiar with without having a rational explanation for it.

When transiting planets turn retrograde they pass over certain degrees of the zodiac a second time; or in some cases up to four times as they move back and forth. Such transits indicate a deepening of the theme indicated by the nature of the transiting planet, its sign, houses, and aspects to other planets.

Retrograde planets also have meaning in Predictive Astrology. Mercury retrograde has a bad reputation for times when communications and transportation go awry. Some astrologers caution against signing contracts during these periods. Mars rules surgeons, so some prefer to avoid surgery when Mars is retrograde. In horary astrology, a retrograde planet is usually considered to be weakened. However, sometimes a retrograde significator can indicate a person who is turning back or revisiting an earlier decision, perhaps due to regrets or second thoughts. Ruler

Domicile
The domicile is the sign ruled by a particular planet. Each of the ten planets is the ruler of at least one sign of the zodiac. Essentially the planet is most "at home" in the sign it rules. The qualities of a sign are considered to be most closely related to those of its ruling planet. When a planet is situated in its "own" sign (for example Venus in Taurus), it is thought to express its inherent qualities most strongly. Planets are also considered to be strong in the sign of their Exaltation and inhibited in expression in the sign of their detriment or fall.

Mercury and Venus are both rulers of two signs of the zodiac. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were also rulers of two signs in the traditional or classical astrological system which used only the seven visible planets. Mars ruled Aries and Scorpio; Jupiter, Sagittarius and Pisces; and Saturn ruled Aquarius alongside Capricorn. With the discovery of the outer planets beyond Saturn, modern astrologers consider Uranus to be the primary ruler of Aquarius; Neptune, the ruler of Pisces; and Pluto, the ruler of Scorpio. Horary Astrology, Traditional Astrology and electional astrologers, however, continue to work with the classical system of rulers.

Lord or Accidental House Cusp Ruler (House Ruler)
The planetary ruler of the sign on a house cusp has considerable influence over the affairs of that house. For example, if someone has Gemini on the cusp of his 10th house, Mercury by its own aspects and house position can supply more information on the affairs of his 10th house. Examining the planet which rules the sign in which a second planet stands is one method to determine the dispositor of the second planet.

Affinities
Each planet, sign, and house has affinities with several types of objects, people, events, animals, and most things imaginable. For example, Jupiter, Sagittarius, and the 9th house all relate to higher education and can be said to rule it. Mars rules soldiers, Taurus rules cattle, the third house rules short-distance travel, and so on. These rulerships are particularly used in Horary Astrology, Electional Astrology, and Medical Astrology. Ruler of the Day

Every day of the week has a planetary ruler
A term which is still used in Popular Astrology that refers to the idea that each day is ruled by one of the seven classical planets.

The days of the week were named in different languages after classical planets, various deities (example: Thursday – Thor's day, a variation after Jupiter's day from Roman times) and heavenly bodies (example: Sunday – Sun's day).

History
According to the ancient scheme of the Chaldean Order[1] the rulers of the day were named for planets that are three places apart in their traditional listing (see illustration below).

The earliest evidence of an astrological significance of a seven-day period is connected to Gudea, priest-king of Lagash in Sumer during the Gutian dynasty, who built a seven-room temple, which he dedicated with a seven-day festival.

Saturn rules Saturday
Each hour of the day has a planetary ruler, as well. Planetary hour rulers are calculated by starting with the planet of the day at sunrise, then attributing a planet to each hour after sunrise, beginning with the outermost planet Saturn, and working inwards across the solar system according to the planets' proximity to the earth, in the following order: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, sun, Venus, Mercury, moon. For example, on Sunday, the sun rules the hour of sunrise, followed by Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, sun, Venus, Mercury, and moon. After the moon, the order repeats itself starting with Saturn again, for the remaining hours of the day. On Monday, the moon rules the first hour starting from sunrise, followed by Saturn, then Jupiter, then Mars, and so on.

Some horary astrologers feel that the chart is fit to be judged, or is at least particularly valid, if the planetary lord of the ascendant is the same as the planetary ruler of the hour. Planetary hours can also be used in electional astrology under the belief that each phenomenon has a planetary ruler, so a good time to undertake an activity involving a particular theme would be when this planetary ruler is also the ruler of the hour. For example, since Venus rules romantic relationships, an hour ruled by Venus should be a good time to promote one's romantic intentions. Ruler of the Year

Astronomy
Saturn is the second largest planet of the Solar System. It is the planet most distant from the sun that can normally be seen in the sky with the naked eye (Uranus is visible under special conditions). Saturn moves slower than all other visible planets. It takes 29 1/2 years to circle the Sun, its fastest diurnal movement is 8.6 minutes of arc, with an average of 2 minutes of arc.

When viewed through a telescope, the most striking feature of Saturn are its rings, which are composed of lumps of rock and ice of various sizes. They turn observation of Saturn into an impressive spectacle.

Greek Mythology
Cronus or Kronos (Latin Saturn) in a general way was simply the personification of time; although this was often meant in a destructive sense. Notwithstanding, as a former king of the gods Cronus ruled over the Greeks' mythical Golden Age.

As a male god, Cronus was the youngest of the first generation of Titans and leader of the gods before Zeus. Encouraged by his mother Gaia, he deposed and castrated his father Ouranos (Uranus) because Ouranos hated the children she bore him and imprisoned them in Tartarus. In order to prevent the same thing recurring with his own children, Cronus devoured his offspring immediately after they were born. Only Zeus, his youngest, managed to escape this fate with the aid of Cronus's wife Rhea.

This myth can be understood metaphorically, as time devouring all things.

Zeus indeed later rose up to avenge his siblings and deposed and castrated his own father. The defeated Cronus was banished to the underworld although Zeus soon took pity on him. He forgave Cronus and sent him to the Isles of the Blessed in the Western Ocean. He did not become involved in the battles of the Olympian gods; his kingdom, like the cycle of the planet Saturn in the sky, was peaceful and leisurely.


Saturn's sigillum[2]
Liz Greene[3]: The Golden Age is an ancient and indestructible human dream. Not only the Bible, but the myths of the Sumerians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans describe it, each with its own story of a Fall when divine law was transgressed by erring humans. And we conjure up the dream of the Golden Age now, whenever we turn to the past and glimpse the shining vision of a time of law and order, when human beings lived in harmony with the cycles of nature and had not yet degenerated into violence and corruption.

In Hesiod's Cosmogony, this Golden Age was under the benign rule of the stern but just Greek deity, Kronos, whom the Romans called Saturn. He was a god of earth, not of heaven, and he governed the orderly cycles of the seasons, the irrevocable passage of time, and the laws by which men and women might live in accord with nature and their own mortality.

As patron of agriculture and lord of the harvest, he symbolized the fertility of the tilled earth and conferred the rewards of honest effort. He was a working god and a wise king, who taught men and women how to press the olive and cultivate the vine. To those who obeyed his laws of discipline, time and mortality, he was a generous ruler who offered peace and abundance. To those who sought to impose their own will on the laws of life itself, he was a merciless and implacable judge.

The Romans worshiped his friendly face at the year's end through the two-week carnival of the Saturnalia, which even Rio, in Brazil, has never succeeded in surpassing. It has been suggested that the name Saturn comes from the Latin sator, meaning to sow; and on the most profound level this god symbolized the dictum that as we sow, so shall we reap.


Saturn: a Grim Reaper, lame old man, and the ruler of Capricorn and Aquarius[4]
Cronus's more contemplative, peaceful characteristics equate with Saturn, who was originally the god of agriculture in ancient Italy. He was also a wise teacher who acquainted humans with the achievements of civilisation and showed them how to cultivate the land. Every year in the middle of December, the Romans commemorated Saturn with a feast called the Saturnalia, when all the usual roles were reversed and masters had to serve the slaves in their own houses.

With the development of western astrology in the Middle Ages, Saturn was personified as an old man, the bringer of the end of life and various misfortunes.

Rulerships
Saturn rules the skeletal frame, teeth, and hair. It is also associated with the skin in its function as the body's boundary.[5]

Saturn rules farmers and old age, a reflection of its mythological heritage. Traditional astrologers attribute most types of misfortunes to Saturn.

Saturn rules the sign of Capricorn and is in detriment in Cancer. It is exalted in Libra and in fall in Aries. Traditional astrologers also cite Saturn as the ruler of Aquarius and its detriment in Leo, whereas modern astrologers give Uranus the rulership of Aquarius.

Interpretation
Saturn, formerly the last planet of our solar system, has been called the "Guardian of the Threshold," beyond which lie the outer planets unknown to astrologers until early modern times. Saturn is the symbol for limitations and hardships; yet Saturn also shows where patience and hard work may pay rewards later in life. It makes individuals aware of the restrictions under which they must live. Saturn therefore symbolizes the rules of society which are designed to uphold law and order; as opposed to more philosophical concerns with justice in the law, symbolised by Jupiter.

Saturn embodies the principle of contraction and concentration, i.e. the focusing on what is essential, the essence of things; as opposed to Jupiter, which is the principle of expansion. As the principle which supports structure, Saturn gives support and stability. It embodies the material world.

Saturn and Jupiter are classified as social planets. Saturn takes on average 2 1/2 years to pass through one sign of the zodiac, which means that all those born during this period have Saturn in the same sign. Its house position and aspects indicate where and how a person is likely to have difficulties and feel inhibited, insecure or possibly trapped. It takes time and hard work for individuals to overcome their fears and further their personal development. Saturn continually confronts us with challenges to overcome, as indicated by its sign and house. Consequently a person can master these areas of life through repeated hard experience.

This process usually becomes easier after the first Saturn return, which occurs at around 29.5 years of age when transiting Saturn makes its first conjunction with Saturn's position in the natal chart. This transit is considered to mark an important stage on the way to personal maturity.

The second Saturn return, occurring around the age of 58, marks the transition from middle age into senior status. Whether or not the individual learned Saturn's lessons becomes apparent around this time. For example, a person who did not save money in middle age might have no retirement income.

Saturn transits indicate a slowing down, a concentration on what is essential. They force an individual to mature and take on responsibility. They usually indicate times of hard work but also the fruits of this hard labour. In traditional astrology, Saturn was feared as a symbol of bad luck, death and the devil. Modern psychological astrologers argue that even though Saturn brings hard lessons in life, it gives great potential to those who are willing to submit to its demands. Its motto is patience and perseverance. These qualities can help a person to achieve great personal insight and inner freedom (Free Will). The pain that often accompanies such processes can be a catalyst that impels an individual to persevere.

Saturn Return[1]
'Synonyms:

Saturn Return Chart

The "Saturn Return Chart" is the horoscope cast for the exact moment of the Saturn return - that is, when Saturn is in the same position as at a person's birth. This so-called "Saturn Revolution" occurs in a person's life approximately every 29-30 years. The Saturn return horoscope focuses on how one deals with inhibitions, responsibilities, and discipline during this period, what one concentrates on, and what paths or questions fate presents to the horoscope owner; in short, it addresses themes of the planet Saturn. It is one of several Return Charts.

Due to Retrograde motion, Saturn touches some zodiac degrees three times. If this occurs exactly at the position where the return takes place, one would actually need to create three return horoscopes. However, it is recommended[2] to take the third transition.

Creating Saturn return horoscopes is a delicate task, as this planet is not one of the Fast Movers, and thus the exact timing of its return often cannot be determined to the minute. This is especially true when it appears to move slowly in the sky or is even stationary from an earthly perspective.

However, the Saturn return is often a significant turning point in a person's life; therefore, despite the challenges of determining the exact timing, the Saturn return is quite enlightening. It is hoped that one can recognize the fundamental tendencies for the following thirty years and thus consciously shape one's life within the outlined possibilities.

For the calculation, location, and Interpretation, the principles outlined under Solar Return Chart apply - the horoscope cast for the solar return, valid for one year - of course, adapted for Saturn. In the Saturn return horoscope, one will primarily focus on this Planet. For example, its house position, aspects, and accidental dignities play a role. However, the entire picture can only be interpreted against the backdrop of the Natal Chart. Fast-moving Planet

Jump to navigationJump to search

Sol Iustitiae (so-called "Sun of Righteousness")[1]
The sign of a planet in its fall is always opposite to its sign of exaltation.

The original Greek term for “fall” can also be translated as “depression”.

In traditional and horary astrology, planets in their fall are weakened, or at least they behave in a way that is foreign to their innate qualities.

Signs of planetary exaltations and falls for the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are not widely agreed upon by modern astrologers, so the falls are usually restricted to the seven traditional planets.

The planet Pluto stays in Gemini for a full thirty years, e.g., from 1882/84 to 1912/14.
In astrology, the term "generation" is used for long-lasting astrological influences.

On one hand, there can be astrological generations regarding specific positions in the zodiac signs of the slow-moving planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Saturn stays in a sign for about two and a half years, meaning that for all those born during this period, its sign position has no individual significance. This becomes even clearer with Uranus, which stays in a sign for an average of seven years, while Neptune remains for 13 to 14 years. Pluto has varying generational durations; in perihelion, it stays in the sign Scorpio for only about eleven years, while it takes 32 years to traverse the sign Taurus, which is in its aphelion. In astrological terminology, it is common to refer to the "generation with Neptune in Capricorn" or the "generation with Pluto in Leo." For these generations, collective commonalities can indeed be observed.

Individual statements regarding astrological generations are possible or meaningful when comparing representatives of such a generation with another. This occurs, for example, in partner comparisons, such as synastries, in composite or combin charts.

Generational Aspect
Secondly, there are astrological generations also in long-lasting aspects between slow-moving planets. The most well-known generational aspect is the sextile between Neptune and Pluto, which has been ongoing with interruptions since the 1940s (the so-called "Hippie Aspect"). Here, hardly any individual statement is possible, except in the case of additional aspects involving personal planets.  Generational Planet
Jump to navigationJump to search

Uranus[1] in true colors
Planets that affect an entire generation of people. The generational planets are the outer planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. They take so long to complete their orbits that everyone born within a multi-year period will have that planet in the same sign.

For example, Uranus has an orbit of 84 years. So it might conjoin the natal Uranus within a person's lifetime.

Neptune has an orbit of 165 years, which is approximately twice the time of Uranus; it spends about 14 years in the same sign. Because it has such a long orbit, an individual may see transiting Neptune form an opposition to their natal Neptune.

Pluto, actually being a planetoid smaller than our own Moon, is very much a twentieth-century planet and refers to the two world wars, and weapons of mass destruction, nuclear power, and a desire to totally control the world we live in. It is a planet that reveals to us the extremes we are capable of if we do not set necessary boundaries in our lives. This planet governs the compulsions in our life: those things we are compelled to do but know we should not, such as rape, drug addiction, and even overeating if it is of such an extent that it threatens our health.

Pluto, circling the Sun in 248 years, has a rather elliptical or eccentric orbit, which means that it stays in the sign it rules, Scorpio, for a mere nine years, and the sign of its fall, Taurus for thirty.

The newly discovered Sedna has an orbit of 11,250 years, so stays in a sign for approximately a millennium. Sign Ruler

The traditional planet-sign rulerships
Each of the ten planets is the ruler of at least one sign of the zodiac. The sign ruler is also said to be domiciled in the sign it rules. From this relationship, a house cusp ruler or lord is the planet that rules the sign located on a house cusp.

The traditional sign rulers appear in a logical sequence when signs are considered like calendar months, with the moon and the sun occupying the months of the summer solstice (Cancer) and its following hot summer month (Leo), respectively. The remaining planets appear domiciled in signs with increasing distance from the sun (planets) or time elapsed from the summer signs of Cancer and Leo. Consequently Mercury rules both Gemini (adjacent to Cancer) and Virgo (next to Leo.) Neighboring Venus rules Taurus and Libra. Mars rules Aries and Scorpio. Continuing around the zodiac, the neighboring sign to Aries, Pisces, is traditionally ruled by Jupiter, as is Sagittarius. This scheme leaves the two signs most distant from the summer solstice, Capricorn and Aquarius, to be ruled by the planet most distant from the sun: Saturn.

Pluto
Modern astrologers either replace some of the sign-rulers with the three planets discovered after the invention of modern telescopes, or else use both modern and traditional rulers. Accordingly, the modern ruler of Aquarius is Uranus; of Pisces, Neptune; and of Scorpio, Pluto. Although astronomers reclassified Pluto as a Dwarf Planet in 2006, astrologers view the heavens somewhat differently. In viewing Pluto as a powerful astrological body, they continue to give Pluto full planet status.

Planets are exceptionally strong when located in the signs they rule.

Sign rulers can help to decipher hidden connections and relationships in a chart. For example, if someone has Mercury in Taurus, she might look to the situation of Venus (the ruler of Taurus) for more information on how her Mercury functions. If someone has Mercury in Taurus and Venus in Gemini (Mercury's domicile), with Mercury in the sign of Venus and Venus in the sign of Mercury, the relationship is called mutual reception and both planets are strengthened.

Statue of Venus[1] - significator of love affairs
The astrological symbol which stands for a particular theme or subject - and the horoscope factor associated with it. The procedure for finding the significator in a horoscope is opposite to the one for interpretation: Usually horoscope factors are interpreted and compared to the concrete life of the person in question, whereas in the case of a significator the concrete facts are translated back into their symbolic form. For example, in the case of religion the astrologer would consider the Ninth House and position of the planet Jupiter, together with other planets in the sign of Sagittarius and the house cusp in this sign.

This approach is important not only for learning how to deal with horoscopes but for gaining a better understanding of horoscopes in general.

We should also take notice of the fact that there are not always clear parallels between astrological terms and the more general ones we use to describe the world around us. The skin is one example: It has Venus as its significator in its function as a sensual organ, but also Saturn in its function as marking the body's outer boundary. Cosmic language and the given situations here on Earth are not necessarily identical.

In horary astrology a planet may take on the role of a significator independently of its usual affinities with particular topics or rulerships. For example, Mercury is not normally associated with marriage, but if it is located in the Seventh House of marriage, it becomes a significator of marriage by virtue of its house placement. Slow-moving Planet
Jump to navigationJump to search

Pluto
The planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. They have extremely long orbital periods: Uranus 84 years, Neptune almost 164, and Pluto 248 years. Saturn, which has an orbital period of 29.5 years, is also sometimes considered to be a slow-moving planet. Because these planets are so far from the sun, they take longer than the Inner Planets to complete their orbits. Consequently, the slow-moving planets stay in the same sign for years.

They are also called Generational Planets because everyone born within the same period of years will have these outer planets in the same sign. Social Planet
Jump to navigationJump to search
Jupiter and Saturn are sometimes described as the social planets. They are the most distant planets visible with the naked eye from earth. With a 12-year orbital period Jupiter spends roughly one year in a sign of the zodiac. Saturn spends about 2.5 years in a sign, with its approximately 29-year orbit; so that people born in the same year (or couple of years)often have these planets in the same sign.

Jupiter and Saturn have meanings relevant to the individual horoscope, but they further represent themes which transcend the individual. With Jupiter these are values and ideals such as morals and ethics which help to give coherence to society. Saturn is concerned with stabilising societal structures and boundaries.

In an individual's horoscope Jupiter indicates good luck, yet it also symbolises the aspiration for noble values, expanding horizons, abundance and generosity. Saturn shows where the person is likely to experience disappointment, yet it also shows the person's potential for self-discipline and practicality.

The term "social planets" differentiates Jupiter and Saturn from the personal planets sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars; and the generational planets Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.

Uranus
The planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. They are not visible with the naked eye owing to their distance from the Earth. The length of their orbital periods means that they can remain in one sign of the zodiac for several years.

It takes Uranus roughly 7 years to pass through one sign of the zodiac, Neptune around 14 and Pluto between 12 and 32.[1]

The spiritual planets were unknown at the time when the fundamental astrological principles were formulated. Uranus was discovered in 1781, Neptune in 1846 and Pluto in 1930. Nevertheless, astrology has been open enough to integrate these new planetary principles. It is also remarkable that the discovery of Uranus coincided with the greatest crisis in the history of astrological thought. But instead of leading to the total downfall of astrology - as many scientists had predicted - the discovery of the planets beyond Saturn and the breakup of the classical system turned out to be a way out of that very crisis.

Uranus, Neptune and Pluto stand for themes which go beyond those represented by the personal planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars) or the social planets (Jupiter and Saturn). They describe spiritual processes. The fact that they aren't visible to the naked eye symbolises their relationship to the spiritual realm which also remains invisible. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto embody principles which lie beyond the outer realm of the material world symbolised by Saturn.

They are also related to that which in Jungian terminology is called the "Collective Unconscious". It is generally difficult for the human mind to gain access to this realm. It is probably true that the majority of individuals have difficulty relating to the energies symbolised by the spiritual planets in a society which concentrates on the material and tangible.

Interpretation
In an individual horoscope, the house position of Uranus and any aspects it makes are more significant than the sign of the zodiac in which it is placed. These indicate where and how a person is likely to experience flashes of intuition which shake the foundations of structures or routinely held beliefs and open up new horizons and perspectives.

The placement of Neptune and any aspects it makes will indicate how and to what extent an individual will experience a dissolving of the boundary between the individual and the collective. Neptune connects us and increases our receptiveness to the immaterial world.

Pluto relates to all fundamental processes of transformation which an individual is forced to confront throughout the course of life - including the ultimate transformation at the time of death.

Van Gogh - Starry Night[1]
In astrology, a star is most commonly referred to as a Fixed Star, similar to its definition in astronomy.

However, in astrology, the historical context is much more prominent than in Astronomy, and therefore the definition is somewhat different: there are Lights in the sky (Sun and Moon, both visible as disks without aids), as well as "stars," meaning all points of light in the firmament. These stars are further distinguished into Fixed Stars and Wandering Stars; the latter refers to the known planets, but other moving celestial bodies in our solar system can also be included. Historically, when telescopes were unknown, only the points of light visible to the naked eye were referred to as stars, which is why Asteroids are rarely understood as stars. Comets were also considered stars in a broader sense in the past, as evident in the term "comet."

The designation of a planet as a star is still common in the terms Morning Star and Evening Star: Venus is usually referred to as such, depending on whether it rises brightly before the Sun (in the morning) or sets prominently bright after it in the west (in the evening).

Although today hardly anyone would refer to a planet as a "star," astrology is still known as the "art of star interpretation," so the historical context remains present. Similarly, when something is said to be "under a good star" (favorable planetary configuration) or the question is asked, "How are the stars today?", the old meaning of stars as "Wandering Stars" (planets) is implied.

If one wants to explicitly refer to Fixed Stars in astrology, this term should be used, rather than speaking generally of stars, to avoid possible misunderstandings. The issue of the lack of linguistic differentiation is evident, for example, in the Star of Bethlehem, where it is still unknown whether it was a Great Conjunction, a comet, a supernova, or celestial phenomena involving Fixed Stars. Superior Planet
Jump to navigationJump to search

Cosmography of Ptolemy[1]
In traditional astrology Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are superior planets, because they appeared to occupy heavenly spheres higher than the sun in astrology's geocentric model.[2] Stationary Phase
Jump to navigationJump to search

Stationary period, direct and retrograde motion of Mars
The transit phase that occurs when a planet moves from direct motion to retrograde motion and vice versa. Ephemerides and some computer programmes indicate the stationary phase by putting an "S" next to the planetary symbol. When a planet is about to change direction (from the earth's perspective), it slows down until it appears to come to a standstill before it changes direction.

The duration of the stationary phase depends on a planet's orbital period - and the definition of what one considers a "standstill". With the slower moving planets (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto) the stationary phase can last up to four weeks if one allows for an orb of several minutes of arc.

4	Notes and References
Interpretation
A direct planet in a natal horoscope and personality expresses its energy more outwardly or extrovertly; whereas a retrograde planet is more inward-looking or introverted. During the stationary phase, the planet's energy becomes concentrated or focused. Similarly, when a transiting planet forms an aspect to a natal planet during its stationary phase, the effect is particularly powerful.

Definition and Duration of the Stationary Phase
Astrodienst Values
Planet	v ≤
Mercury	5' or 300"/ day
Venus	3' or 180"/ day
Mars	90"/ day
Jupiter	60"/ day
Saturn	60"/ day
Chiron	20"/ day
Uranus	20"/ day
Neptune	10"/ day
Pluto	10"/ day
It is not possible to specify an exact duration of the stationary phases, since the velocity (v) of a planet continuously changes from the geocentric point of view, and every indication of the duration of station corresponds to a more or less arbitrary definition. Astrodienst uses a simple pragmatic definition, see table on the left.

One possibility is to derive the definition of a station from the speed of the celestial body concerned, for example if it is below 5% or 2% of its maximum speed. For example, with Mercury, which moves a maximum of about 100 arc minutes per day, the speed at which one can speak of its station is 5 or 2 arc minutes per day.

At what point one regards a planet as resting, however, lies in the experience and discretion of the individual astrologer.

Cosmography of Ptolemy[1]
The astrological system of the ancient astrologer Ptolemy assigned each planet to its own concentric sphere surrounding the earth. Because Mercury and Venus were assigned spheres lower than the sun, traditional astrologers call them inferior planets.[2 Inferior Conjunction
Jump to navigationJump to search

Upper and lower conjunction
Because Mercury and Venus are the only planets to orbit the sun inside the earth's orbit they can, viewed from the earth, form either a superior ("upper") or an inferior ("lower") conjunction with the sun.

In the case of the inferior conjunction, the planet involved is situated between the earth and the sun; while in the case of the superior conjunction the planet is behind the sun. When Mercury or Venus are moving retrograde when conjuncting the sun, they form an inferior conjunction, and if they are direct, an upper conjunction is formed.
ChatGPT said:
You’ve basically compiled a full encyclopedia entry on planetary dignities, rulerships, retrogrades, and slow/fast-moving planets. Let me break it down into a coherent, high-level synthesis that preserves the nuance, but makes it more digestible:

1. Exaltation and Fall
Exaltation = a planet in a sign where its qualities shine in “pure form.” Think of it as a planet in its spiritual or optimal home.

Sun → Aries (19°)

Moon → Taurus (3°)

Mercury → Virgo (15°)

Venus → Pisces (27°)

Mars → Capricorn (28°)

Jupiter → Cancer (15°)

Saturn → Libra (21°)

Fall = opposite of exaltation; planet feels “awkward” or restricted.

Example: Sun falls in Libra, Moon in Scorpio, Mars in Cancer.

2. Planetary Motion
Direct motion → normal forward path through zodiac.

Retrograde → apparent backward motion; planet’s energy turns inward, fostering introspection or review.

Mercury retrograde = reviewing, redoing, reassessing.

Retrograde planets in natal charts = innate tendencies internalized, sometimes harder to express outwardly.

Stationary phase → transition between retrograde and direct; energy is focused and concentrated.

3. Planetary Rulerships
Domicile = sign a planet rules; planet is “at home” here.

Ex: Venus rules Taurus and Libra; Mars rules Aries and Scorpio.

Modern adjustments: Uranus → Aquarius, Neptune → Pisces, Pluto → Scorpio.

Chart Ruler = planet ruling your Ascendant; central to your life theme.

House Ruler = planet ruling the sign on a house cusp; influences that area of life.

Day and Hour Rulers: Each day/hour is ruled by a planet, influencing the energies and suitable activities for that period.

Yearly Rulers: Each year has a planetary ruler (following Chaldean order), historically used in agricultural and societal predictions.

4. Planet Classifications
Fast-moving / Personal planets → Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars (short orbital periods; individual expression).

Slow-moving / Generational planets → Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto (long periods; societal/generational themes).

Social planets → Jupiter, Saturn (bridges individual and societal concerns).

Spiritual planets → Uranus, Neptune, Pluto (hidden, collective, unconscious, transformative forces).

5. Saturn Highlights
Symbolizes: limitations, structure, patience, responsibility, maturity.

Mythology: Cronus / Saturn → time devouring all, Golden Age, law & order, agriculture.

Saturn Return → ~29.5 years, key life milestone; first return (~29) = adulthood/learning responsibility, second return (~58) = elder wisdom and consequences of life choices.

6. Generations
Slow-moving planets define astrological generations: e.g., Pluto in Gemini (1882–1912), Neptune in Capricorn (~13–14 years per sign).

Long-term aspects between slow movers also mark generational influence (e.g., Neptune–Pluto sextile of the 1940s).

7. Stars & Fixed Stars
Stars historically = visible points of light; “wandering stars” = planets.

Fixed Stars have specific influences in horoscopes; historically used to mark important celestial events (e.g., Star of Bethlehem).

If you want, I can make a single, visual chart/table that maps planets → signs → exaltation/fall → rulerships → motion type → generational meaning. That would condense all this info into one intuitive “at-a-glance” reference.

Do you want me to do that?

Inclination
Jump to navigationJump to search
Orbital Inclination is a term for the angle between two orbital planes. It is often used to describe the movement of celestial bodies such as stars and planets.

One of the planes is the standard, or reference. The galactic plane of a galaxy is often used as the reference.

For a planet's orbit, the inclination is the angle to the ecliptic plane.
For a planetary moon, an inclination of 0 degrees means the orbiting body orbits the planet in its equatorial plane, in the same direction as the planet rotates. Inner Planets
Jump to navigationJump to search

Venus definitely is an inner planet: it never appears far from the Sun
There are two ways of defining the inner and outer planets.

Those planets whose orbits around the sun lie within the earth's own orbit: Mercury and Venus. The sun and moon are either categorized separately as the luminaries or are included as inner planets.
Planets that move relatively quickly around the sun and thus are not "generational" planets in signs; and that relate more closely to personal life experiences.
In contrast, outer planets are defined either as orbiting outside of the earth's orbit, or as spending so much time in a given sign that they define an entire generation. Jupiter

Astronomy
Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. The diameter at its equator is 142,984 km, eleven times the size of the Earth. Its average distance from the Sun is 778.4 million km. It takes Jupiter roughly twelve years to make one orbit around the Sun. The maximum daily movement is 15.40 minutes, the average is 5 minutes.

Mythology
Zeus (Jupiter or Jove in Latin) was the king of the gods and ruler of Mount Olympus. He is also known as the "god of thunder" or "father of the gods and humanity". He and his brothers Poseidon (Neptune), god of the sea; and Hades (Pluto), god of the underworld, collectively ruled the universe. Zeus was the son of Rhea and Cronus (Saturn). Cronus achieved world domination by emasculating his father Uranus. Out of fear that the same fate could befall him he devoured his newly-born children. Rhea managed to save Zeus from this fate by giving Cronus a stone wrapped in a blanket in his place. She smuggled the newborn Zeus to Crete where the Nymphs hid and raised him.

On reaching maturity, Zeus set off to free his siblings and overthrow his father. He was aided by the goddess Metis who gave Cronus a potion which made him vomit all his children, together with the stone Rhea had given him. The battle against Cronus, who put up great resistance to losing his power, lasted ten years. When it was over, the younger generation of gods led by Zeus conquered the older one.

Zeus married the goddess Hera (whom the Romans called Juno), who among other things ruled marriage. As was the prerogative of ancient rulers, Zeus took innumerable lovers, both willing and unwilling. For this reason he had innumerable offspring in various Mediterranean ethnic groups who claimed his divine paternity. His marriage with Hera was characterized by continuous quarrels. Hera ruthlessly pursued her husband's lovers and their children. Zeus tried to protect them whenever possible and punished Hera for her callousness.

There were many attempts to overthrow Zeus, but he always managed to overcome them. During those times in which he felt secure in his position, he was an unbiased, generous father of the gods who guided events both in heaven and on earth with dignity. The ancients held him in great esteem.

Liz Greene[2]: Jupiter is the largest planet, and in myth he is also the biggest of the gods. In Babylon, this deity, king of heaven and dispenser of law and justice, was called Bel, Lord of the Air. He ruled over the hurricane and held the insignia of royalty which he bestowed upon the earthly kings of his choice.

In Teutonic and Norse myth, he was known as Odin (Wotan), ruler of the gods, who granted heroism and victory and ordained the laws which governed human society.

In Greece, he achieved his noblest and most humanized face as Zeus, father of gods and men. The name Zeus comes from a Sanskrit word which means light or lightning, and as bearer of the thunderbolt which illuminated heaven, Olympian Zeus was worshiped as the All-high throughout the ancient world. In many ways he resembles our Judeo-Christian image of the Almighty Father - omnipotent, omniscient and the source of all moral law. But Zeus was not solely a benevolent, fatherly deity. He was also restless, vain, bad-tempered and incurably promiscuous, and mated with innumerable mortal women to produce a race of heroes or demigods, who became the chief protagonists of Greek myth, poetry, drama and art.

Son of the earth god Kronos, Zeus had to fight his father to claim his kingdom and establish the dominance of heaven over earth. To human beings, he was alternatively spiteful and generous - not unlike Yahveh of the Old Testament attempting to destroy the human race with a great flood, yet conferring immeasurable wealth, power and honor on those he favored.

The Romans called him Jupiter, or Jove, and the joyful, energetic and dramatic nature of this god has found its way into the English language in the adjective "jovial".

Rulerships
Jupiter rules Sagittarius. It is the traditional ruler of Pisces: Neptune is the modern ruler.

Jupiter is exalted in Cancer, falls in Capricorn, and is in detriment in Virgo.

Medical Astrology
Jupiter is associated with the liver, one of the largest and most important organs and the largest gland in the body.

Because of Jupiter's association with the principle of expansion, it also may be implicated in illnesses of excess and over-indulgence.

Interpretation
As befits a sky-god who surveyed the world from Mount Olympus, Jupiter is associated with wisdom and a panoramic perspective on life. From this viewpoint comes an association with philosophy and theology. Jupiter expresses optimism and good luck, leading traditional astrologers to call it the "great benefic."

Jupiter and Saturn are considered to be the two social planets. Their long orbital periods indicate longer developmental processes which connect whole groups of people from one or several years (as opposed to the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars, which are the more Personal Planets. Jupiter's orbital period of roughly one year per sign means that all individuals born within this time will have the planet in the same sign of the zodiac.

Like Saturn, Jupiter symbolizes powers which go beyond what is necessary for strictly personal development and touch on themes relevant to the wider society. With Jupiter these include justice in the light of a higher social order, morality in the sense of an ethical order, and religion in the sense of divine order. These are qualities which enable the coexistence of different individuals within a community or society.

Jupiter stands for the principle of expansion. Its house position and zodiac sign reveal how and in which area of life an individual will attempt to expand his or her horizons: whether by travelling to distant lands and experiencing foreign cultures; or by observing and pondering themes of a philosophical, ideological or religious nature. The house position of Jupiter indicates the area of life in which an individual strives towards higher ideals, meaning and growth in the broadest sense.

Jupiter is concerned with holistic understanding, as opposed to Mercury with its attention to detail and ability to make connections between various individual factors.

On a material or practical level Jupiter is associated with expansion of the affairs of that house. For example, Jupiter in the 5th house of children might confer a large family; or Jupiter in the 2nd house of money might give wealth. The horoscope is seldom so simple, however, and many factors will affect a given house, so it is important to look at how Jupiter is situated in the horoscope overall.

When natal Jupiter aspects an Axis or another planet it emphasizes the qualities of expansion and meaning in the horoscope factor involved. With harmonious aspects this process is likely to run smoothly even if there can sometimes be a tendency to be too relaxed and therefore idle. With difficult aspects an individual may become over-extended.

The themes are similar when Transitimg Jupiter forms an aspect to planets or an axis in the natal chart. However, Jupiter transits should not be overestimated because of their fairly short duration and therefore limited effects, with the possible exception of threefold transits which can occur when Jupiter turns retrograde and direct again.

In Traditional Astrology Jupiter is the planet of great fortune; along with Venus, the bringer of mild good fortune. Lord

General
The term Lord has several meanings in astrology, and is often used synonymously with the word ruler. Most commonly it indicates the planet that rules the sign on a house cusp. In this capacity, the lord of a particular house has considerable influence over the affairs of that house, according to its own house placement and aspects.

When a house is untenanted or unoccupied by any planets, the lord of a house becomes especially useful in understanding how that house functions. However, the lords of a person's sun, moon, and ascendant houses also exert considerable influence in how they operate.

Lords are sometimes called "accidental house cusp rulers". The term "accidental" means by virtue of the circumstances of a particular horoscope, rather than by virtue of the planet having a special natural or "essential" affinity for the house. The lord of the first house is sometimes called the chart ruler in modern astrology. It should be an important planet in the person's basic orientation to life.

Example: Mother Teresa
Mother Teresa was a nun who ran a hospital for the ill and dying poor of Calcutta, India. The lord of her tenth house of vocation is Venus, located in the traditional eighth house of death. The sun, lord of her eighth house, is also located in the eighth. Jupiter, lord of her first house (chart ruler) conjuncts her Medium Coeli. The lord of her moon's house is also in the eighth.

After Mercury Venus is the second planet whose orbit lies inside the Earth's orbit, and this means that it can never be more than 47 degrees away from the Sun from the Earth's perspective (Elongation).

It has a diameter of 12104 km which makes it almost the same size as the Earth. Its average distance from the Sun is 108.21 million km and takes just over 224 days to make one complete orbit around the Sun (sidereal orbit) and 10 to 12 months to go through the whole zodiac. Its average daily movement is 1 degree, 15 minutes of arc. From the Earth's perspective, Venus is the brightest heavenly body after the Sun and the Moon.

Like Mercury Venus appears either as the Evening Star or the morning star, although the term typically refers to Venus. In the case of the former (evening star), Venus appears on the eastern horizon before the rising Sun and is behind the Sun in the zodiac; in the case of the latter, Venus is still visible on the Western horizon after the Sun has set and is in front of the Sun in the zodiac. When Venus is within 10 degrees of the Sun it is not visible to the naked eye.

Mythology
Liz Greene[1]: As both the Morning and the Evening Star, the planet Venus has always been linked in myth with the goddess of beauty, joy and erotic love. Perhaps the magic of this heavenly body, rising just before dawn or gracing the sunset, evoked the image of an intimate deity tantalizingly close to the human heart, who was not ashamed to show herself naked to mortals.

In Babylon, she was known as Ishtar, and she presided not over the sanctity of marriage and family, but over the pleasures of illicit erotic encounters. In Egypt, she was called Hathor, patroness of dance and orgiastic sexual rites, and was also portrayed as Bast, cat-headed mistress of magic and sexual arts.

In Greece, she was called Aphrodite, a subtle and complex goddess, golden-skinned and golden-haired, vain and capricious but the undisputed bringer of all beauty and delight. In Greek art, unlike other more modest goddesses, she was portrayed nude, reflecting an unashamed appreciation of sexual love. Her sacred flowers -the rose and the lily- reflect her eroticism in their heavy perfume. Her bird, the dove, was seen as the gentlest and most affectionate of nature's creatures.

Yet Aphrodite, whom the Romans called Venus, could also be terrible and threatening. In Sparta she was worshiped as a battle goddess, for the ancient Greeks understood that the ecstasy of bloodletting can, for some, be as sexually exciting as the act of sex itself as the horrific overlap of war and mass rape have demonstrated throughout the centuries.

Refined and primitive at the same time, she presided over artists, craftsmen and the arts of cosmetic beautification. Yet she also embodied the forces of uncontrollable desire, for she afflicted unsuspecting mortals with the madness of obsessive lust, and could topple rulers and kingdoms into the golden net of her passions.

In ancient Sumer and Babylon, where the precursors of horoscopic astrology originated, the planet Venus was associated with the goddesses Inanna and Ishtar, respectively. These goddesses had a far greater repertory than their cognate goddesses Aphrodite (Greek) and Venus (Roman) as they were associated with fits of temper and warfare, as well as with physical beauty and love. The name Inanna may derive from Nin-Ana, Sumerian for "Lady of the Sky." In her Phoenician version as Ashthoreth, she may have been the "Queen of Heaven" condemned by biblical prophets.

Although it is hard to say why this planet's worshippers should have associated her with strife, the planets in Sumer and throughout most of Babylonian history, were used as celestial omens. Possibly an early star-gazer noticed that the planet Venus in particular configurations coincided with times of war. Also, the early star-watchers noticed the seemingly irregular movements of Venus as morning and evening star, and likened the planet to a willful woman.

Aphrodite/Venus was one of the twelve Olympian gods. She was the goddess of love, fertility and beauty. Her sobriquet "foam-arisen" alludes to her birth. The titan Kronos (Saturn) had castrated and overthrown his father Uranus at the behest of his mother Gaia and thrown his genitals into the sea. The sea started to foam at the place where he threw them in and from it arose Aphrodite in all her beauty. The world was immediately struck by her charm and as she emerged from the water flowers blossomed under her feet.

Aphrodite was married to Hephaistos, the divine blacksmith and god of fire. Although the relationship symbolizes aesthetics in the arts and crafts, it was an unhappy marriage. Hephaistos was ugly and had a limp but was the greatest craftsman. Aphrodite was not satisfied with this combination. As the embodiment of sensuality and passion she sought more attractive lovers such as Ares (Mars), the god of war. True to her Near Eastern foremothers, Aphrodite's passionate nature led her to become embroiled in most of the battles and intrigues among the gods. She was in no way the naive, shallow beauty as the present day image of Venus suggests. Her admirers could rely on her support. However, she severely punished anyone who displeased her.

In Traditional Astrology Venus particularly has to do with women, luxuries, and esthetics. Although a badly placed Venus could make people lazy or give them difficulties through women, the effect of Venus was generally seen to be beneficial, giving the planet the nickname of the "lesser benefic."[3]

Rulerships
Venus rules the signs of Taurus and Libra. It is in detriment in Scorpio and Aries: the signs ruled by her lover Mars as the traditional and sole ruler, respectively. Venus is exalted in Pisces and falls in Virgo.

Venus is associated with the organs of equilibrium, together with the kidneys which have an important influence on the regulation of the circulatory system and hematopoiesis as well as the balance between acidity and alkalinity in the body. The balancing quality of Venus is also expressed in the body's venal system: The arteries pump blood enriched with oxygen around the body to the organs and the veins then transport the blood back to the heart. Venus is also associated with the skin in its capacity as a sensual organ. (The skin is associated with Saturn in medical astrology, in its function as the outer boundary of the body.)

Venus generically rules the fine and performing arts, aesthetics, luxuries, and many items and professions associated with women. In a woman's chart, Venus shows her sense of femininity and female sexuality. In a heterosexual man's chart, Venus shows the type of woman to whom he is attracted.


Venus by the artist Gertrud Ring[4]
Interpretation
Venus in the natal chart symbolises that energy which seeks harmony, whether through relationships, the love of another person, or love of beauty as expressed in the arts. She also stands for the principle of attraction and what is attractive about a person.

Venus' position by house and sign describes how individuals interact with others, what they like, or how they satisfy their need for harmony. It shows how one loves and wants to be loved, how one expresses and wishes to receive affection. It indicates the kind of things that bring someone pleasure and what is likely to appeal to an individual's aesthetic nature.

In a woman's chart, Venus and the Moon represent important aspects of her feminine identity. Venus is associated with the erotic and sexuality, and taken together with Mars reveals an individual's attitude to these aspects of life. In a man's chart, Venus and the Moon reveal his image of the feminine; whether positive or negative.

A planet or axis aspected by Venus will be coloured by some of the Venusian qualities such as charm and beauty. Even a hard aspect will be softened if Venus is one of the planets involved.

Transiting Venus generally stimulates sensual perception for a short period, as it normally stays in one degree for less than a day. It may indicate a pleasant period. Uranus

Astronomy
Uranus is the first planet of modernity to be discovered beyond Saturn: the astronomer Wilhelm Herschel discovered Uranus on the 13th March 1781 with the help of a telescope and his sister Caroline Herschel, who became a respected astronomer in her own right. Uranus is four times the size of the Earth. It has an equatorial diameter of 51118 km and its average distance from the Sun is 2883 million km. It requires around 84 years to make one orbit of the Sun and has a maximum diurnal movement of 4 minutes of arc, although the average is just 42 seconds of arc.

One striking feature of Uranus is that its rotational axis is tilted at such an angle that it almost lies on its orbital plane.

Greek Mythology
Ouranos (Latin Uranus or Caelus) was the oldest god in antiquity. Gaia (Latin Terra or Tellus,) the Earth, gave birth to him: either without the involvement of another man, or with Aether, the god of the upper air and light of heaven. Greek authors understood Ouranos both as an ancient male deity, and also as the dome of the sky itself, or the heavens. Gaia, the original Mother Earth, had her counterpart in Ouranos, the Father Sky. Until the god Ouranos was deposed by Cronus (Saturn) and subsequently by Zeus (Jupiter), Ouranos brought fertility to Gaia in the form of rainfall.

As a married couple Ouranos and Gaia had numerous children, among them the Titans and Cyclops. However, Ouranos hated some of his offspring so much that he pushed them back into the Earth which almost caused Gaia to suffocate. She therefore encouraged her son Cronus (Saturn), the most important of the Titans, to overthrow his father and to castrate him with a sickle.

Although Cronus was successful in overthrowing Ouranos, the deed had unforeseen consequences. Aphrodite (Latin Venus), the goddess of love and beauty, rose up from the waters at the place where Cronus threw the castrated member and from his blood that touched the earth rose the Erinyes, terrifying female goddesses of revenge who always appeared to punish those who broke natural laws.

Some astrologers do not think that the qualities of the mythological Ouranos fit with those of the astrological planet Uranus. They believe instead that Prometheus (the foreseeing one), who brought the divine fire to humankind and rebelled against Zeus, the king of the gods, is a more fitting figure. When Ouranos is understood as the backdrop of the sky, with all of its heavenly bodies and weather systems, however, it seems like a fitting addition to astrology.

Liz Greene[3]: To ancient peoples, the beauty and vastness of the star-studded vault of heaven revealed the awesome power and intelligence of an invisible creator god. In Egypt, this ineffable deity was known as Atum, a formless spirit who bore within him the sum of all existence. The Egyptian sky goddess, Nut, was his feminine face, portrayed with her star-encrusted body bent to form the dome of heaven, touching the earth beneath with her fingertips and toes.

In Babylon, the god of heaven was called Anu, whose name simply means "sky". He was the supreme creator god but, like the Egyptian Atum, he remained aloof and beyond the comprehension of mortal beings. So, too, did the ancient Greek god Ouranos or Uranus, whose name means "the sky crowned with stars" and who - true to his transcendent nature -, was rarely portrayed in sculpture or painting.

Unlike the colorful Zeus, that other great Greek divinity of the heights, Uranus was not endowed with lovable, fallible human traits. A much older power, his physical face was the sky itself, for he existed from the dawn of time, before the other gods came into being.

The God of Genesis, whose spirit moved over the face of the primordial deep, is closely akin to the Greek portrayal of a vast, dimly sensed deity by whose power the design of creation is accomplished. Uranus, god of the starry heavens, is an ancient and awesome portrayal of the divine mind that conceived the idea of a universe before any universe was made.

In order to grasp the astrological symbol of Uranus, we need to consider the process by which human beings make things happen in the world. Before we create any complex structure - a book, a house, a business, a musical composition, the constitution of a nation - we must have an idea of the finished product in our minds.

This idea may be built up through logical thought or it may strike, fully formed, through a sudden flash of inspiration. We may be conscious of it or we may be guided unconsciously, unaware of the source of our actions. But without it, nothing coherent can be produced.

The process of bringing an idea to birth in reality is evident, both in political leadership and in artistic fields such as architecture, interior design or theater direction, where the entire concept must be held in mind before any of the individual components can be fitted together.

Interpretation
The discovery of Uranus radically expanded the dimensions of the known solar system, as it is twice as far from the earth as Saturn, and this radical expansion fits with the quality of Uranian energy. Uranus symbolises radical changes, upheavals, and the penetration into previously unknown dimensions. If the discovery of Uranus is considered against the backdrop of events at the time of its discovery, it symbolizes many of the ideals of the American (1776) and French Revolutions, (1789); as well as the Enlightenment: freedom, equality, and fraternity.

The position of Uranus by sign in the natal chart is considered to be less important than its house position and aspects, because Uranus is a "generational planet." All the individuals born during the seven year period in which Uranus stays in one sign will have it in the same sign.

Uranus in a birth chart ideally expresses an individual's potential for liberation. Negatively Uranus may only signal the person's need to "act out" or where he most fears disruption. The house position of Uranus may show where an individual tends to be unconventional, spontaneous, original, freedom-loving and likely to break with convention. If it has difficult aspects a person might, under certain circumstances, feel compelled to act in an unconventional manner that is merely disruptive rather than liberating. Freedom and unconventionality were not prized personal qualities for most people prior to the discovery of Uranus. Therefore Uranus suggests a temporal moving beyond Saturn's sense of authority and hierarchy.

When Uranus aspects another planet or Angle it tends to "electrify" the horoscope factor involved, which tends to express itself in original, different, and unexpected ways. Uranus aspects are also associated with sudden flashes of inspiration which can bring sudden and intuitive understanding of complex ideas.

The effects are similar when transiting Uranus forms aspects with planets in the natal chart. A Uranus transit revolutionises the existing order and can be accompanied by a sudden and intuitive understanding of complex ideas. Taken negatively, Uranus may only show when to expect sudden endings or beginnings; often unwanted. Difficult Uranus transits offer hope that the person can become more open to change and less set in her ways, however.

Medical Astrology
Uranus is associated with the human nervous system in its capacity to transmit information.

Nerves carry physical stimulations of the sensory organs to the brain which in turn sends impulses to the body's muscles.

Rulerships
Uranus is the modern ruler of Aquarius. There is no agreement about its exaltation or fall, with some astrologers arguing that the modern planets do not fit into the traditional system of assigning modern planetary Dignities.

Uranus is also the modern ruler of electronics, aviation, and most things technological that might be onsidered futuristic, or at least as truly modern at one time, such as automobiles. In a different manifestation of its futuristic qualities, Uranus is also associated with disruption of established social orders. Where Saturn seeks to structure and stabilize what it touches, Uranus tends to disrupt (some would say "liberate") it.

Mercury is the traditional ruler of astrology, but modern astrologers assign it to Uranus. This connection makes little sense in light of the god Uranus's troubling family history or the planet's association with radical change. Ouranos as the ancient Greeks' name for the starry heavens, however, offers a fitting association between Uranus and astrology.  Unaspected Planet
Jump to navigationJump to search
Synonym: Isolated Planet

An unaspected planet is one which has no Major Aspect linking it to any other planets.

However, if Minor Aspects are also taken into account, it is very rare for a planet to be completely unaspected.

Interpretation
An unaspected planet is usually difficult for the horoscope native to integrate. Its energy tends to develop in isolation and waver between two extremes of expression: it can either be hardly noticeable, or is so dominant in certain situations that it overshadows the rest of the chart. Such a planet is comparable to an actor in an improvised play who has no interaction with his fellow actors. He may remain largely in the background so that the play unfolds without his presence being felt, or else his presence is so great that the other actors can hardly get a word in edgewise.

An unaspected Saturn can mean that the individual finds it difficult to plan for and cope with the practical aspects of everyday life. She may suffer from a lack of self-discipline, which impedes turning ideas into practice, because her Saturn has no major support or challenge from another planet. However, when an unaspected Saturn is activated by Transit, the situation is often transformed and the individual can come under great pressure to implement an unacostumed strict regime of discipline. However, it is up to the individual to decide whether to achieve her desired goals, or to capitulate under the pressure and waits till the transit is over.

If a chart contains several unaspected planets, their influence tends to be less extreme and the individual is usually more able to cope with the tendency of each planet to go it alone. Several unaspected planets in a chart are more like soloists who still manage to form something resembling an orchestra.

The qualities that often cause difficulties with unaspected planets are also their source of strength: the energy which develops largely in isolation without regard to the other planets can end up being expressed with great originality.

Terminology: The Greek term ἀστεροειδής, or asteroeidēs, means star-like, star-shaped, and is derived from the Ancient Greek ἀστήρ astēr (star, planet) An asteroid can be defined as "an irregularly shaped rocky body orbiting the Sun that does not qualify as a planet or a dwarf planet under the IAU definitions of those terms". Traditionally, small bodies orbiting the Sun were classified as comets, asteroids, or meteoroids, with anything smaller than one meter across being called a meteoroid.
The term "asteroid" never had a formal definition. Synonyms: planetoid (literally: planet-like); Minor Planet[2].

One of the smaller celestial bodies - largely made up of rocky material - that orbit the Sun in a similar way as the more well-known planets.

Number, History & Size
Asteroids vary greatly in size, from a few metres diameter up to nearly 950 Km. The first asteroids, which remain the most widely known, were discovered at the beginning of the 19th century (Napoleonic era): Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta; although the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Ceres as a Dwarf Planet in 2006. Asteroids are distinguished from actual planets by having insufficient gravity to become round in shape and to "clear their orbit" of smaller bodies in the vicinity by attracting them to the surface or in orbit around them as satellites. The three largest asteroids are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors, and are thought to be surviving protoplanets. The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either battered planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies.

As of April 2022, the Minor Planet Center had data on 1,199,224 minor planets in the inner and outer Solar System, of which about 614,690 had enough information to be given numbered designations. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is only 3% that of Earth's Moon. The dwarf planet Ceres is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of 940 km (580 mi). The next largest are Vesta and Pallas, both with diameters of just over 500 km (300 mi). Vesta is the brightest of the first four main-belt asteroids. The four largest objects, Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea, account for maybe 62% of the belt's total mass, with 39% accounted for by Ceres alone.

Contrary to popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that reaching an asteroid without aiming carefully would be improbable. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100 km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has between 700,000 and 1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1 km or more.

Threats to Earth?
Near-Earth asteroids can threaten all life on the planet. There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross Earth's, and that could collide with Earth. The three most important groups of near-Earth asteroids are the Apollos, Amors, and Atens.

Observability
Only one asteroid, Vesta, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye. When favorably positioned, Vesta can be seen in dark skies.

Orbits
The majority of main belt asteroids follow slightly elliptical, stable orbits, revolving in the same direction as the Earth and taking from three to six years to complete a full circuit of the Sun. Most asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. Thus, a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the ecliptic. Yet, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane. Recent observations are increasingly blurring the distinction between Comets and asteroids, suggesting "a continuum between asteroids and comets" rather than a sharp dividing line.

Numerous asteroids have orbits that lie between Mars and Jupiter, in the so-called Asteroid Belt. Ceres, Pallas and Vesta are the three largest bodies in the asteroid belt. Also, Juno is in the asteroid belt. There is another belt of asteroids in the solar system, the so-called Kuiper Belt which lies beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto. The Kuiper Belt is thought to contain a much greater number of asteroids than the asteroid belt. The present consensus is that the Kuiper Belt is made up of matter which was prevented from condensing into one planet - in this case by the pull of Neptune's gravitational field. Pluto has recently been classified as the largest celestial body belonging to the Kuiper Belt and reclassified as a Dwarf Planet.

The so-called Centaurs have also been classified as asteroids. Their orbits around the Sun lie between Jupiter and Neptune, and they would appear to function as a "bridge between asteroids and comets, or/ and the ancestors of comets." The most known centaur is Chiron.

Meteorites
Some of the debris from collisions can form Meteors that enter the Earth's atmosphere. Of the 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt.

Asteroid mining?
The concept of asteroid mining was proposed in 1970s. As resource depletion on Earth becomes more real, the idea of extracting valuable elements from asteroids and returning these to Earth for profit, or using space-based resources to build solar-power satellites and space habitats, becomes more attractive.

Exploration
The first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by multiple spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Cassini measured plasma and fine dust grains while traversing the belt in 2000. On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are estimated at less than 1 in 1 billion.

Most main belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief flyby opportunities by probes headed for other targets. Only the Dawn mission has studied main belt asteroids for a protracted period in orbit. The Galileo spacecraft imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991[3] and 243 Ida in 1993, then NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997 and landed on near–Earth asteroid 433 Eros in February 2001. Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, and Rosetta imaged 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010. Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015.

The Lucy space probe is expected to make a flyby of 152830 Dinkinesh in 2023, on its way to the Jupiter Trojans. ESA's JUICE mission will pass through the asteroid belt twice, with a proposed flyby of the asteroid 223 Rosa in 2029. The Psyche spacecraft is a planned NASA mission to the large M-type (metallic) asteroid 16 Psyche.

Astrology
Asteroids are relatively new to astrology, and still only a minority of astrologers use them in chart interpretation. Their use in astrology began with Eleanor Bach's publication of the first asteroid ephemeris in 1973. Their use was popularized following Demetra George's publication of Asteroid Goddesses in 1986.

The first four
Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (in order of discovery) were the only known asteroids from 1808 until 1845, when additional asteroids began to be discovered. They started being recognized by astrologers in the 1970s.

Ceres symbol (planetary color).svg Ceres
Ceres was the first asteroid discovered and now is labeled as a dwarf planet, taking up about 1/3 of the entire mass of the asteroid belt. (According to some astrologers, to get an understanding of the nature of a planet, astrologers may study the characteristics and positions of known planets at the time of discovery, observe the trend of significant events at the time, and evaluate over time what the newly discovered celestial body tends to relate to in the charts of living people.) In mythology Ceres was the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Demeter. She was the goddess of agriculture and when her daughter Persephone was kidnapped by Pluto in an attempt to force her to marry him, Demeter became so distraught looking for her daughter that she neglected the Earth which became cold and most plants died. This was the first autumn and winter season, which came back every year even after Persephone had been saved by Hermes because she had eaten a pomegranate that made her Pluto's wife forever, and he demanded she return to him once a year. These myths, including the fact that Ceres is the roundest asteroid (it resembles the Moon) signify that in astrology the placement of Ceres in a birth chart is said to show what the native needs to feel loved and nurtured.

Pallas symbol (planetary color).svgPallas
Sometimes known as "Pallas Athene", this is the second asteroid discovered and the third in mass. There are many Pallases in mythology. Some sources say Pallas was Triton's daughter and Athena's playmate who was killed and Athena mourned her by changing her name to Pallas and making a wooden statue of her, which Zeus dropped to the Land of Troy where a temple was built in its honor. Others say that Pallas was an old god who combined with Athena. In these respects, Pallas can be interpreted as an indicator of effort. Other astrologers interpret it as an indicator of wisdom, intelligence, healing (perhaps through effort) as the titan named Pallas was a god of these things. This asteroid, like Vesta, is also sometimes called an influencer of Virgo.

Juno symbol (planetary color).svgJuno
This asteroid was the 3rd to be discovered and is 9th in mass ranking (1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 4 Vesta, 10 Hygiea, 511 Davida, 704 Interamnia, 65 Cybele, 52 Europa are considerably bigger and more massive). In mythology Juno is the Roman equivalent of the Greek Hera. Hera was a very important goddess in both Greek and Roman culture. She was a wife of Zeus and hailed as the Queen of Gods and Zeus' main concubine (at least the myths imply that this was what she thought herself). She was the goddess of marriages, unions, and was also associated with finance and found cows and peacocks to be sacred. She was also very jealous and aggressive, especially when Zeus was involved with another woman; she would often kill the children Zeus and the other women or goddesses would create together, including attempts to kill Hercules and Dionysus — or the woman herself. For these reasons, Juno is used in astrology as an indicator of what a native requires to feel satisfied in love or romance, or what is one needs in order to feel their marriage is successful and satisfying. Because of Juno's association with relationships, money, cows and jealousy, it also appears to have an influence of the sign Taurus.

Vesta symbol (planetary color).svgVesta
This asteroid is the second largest in mass, fourth to be discovered of which it is the fastest to travel the zodiac and the last asteroid to be counted as a planet. In mythology Vesta is the virgin goddess, the Roman version of Hestia, though she was of higher importance to the Romans. She was regarded as one of the most important goddesses of all, though ironically she never was depicted in any visual art (in Greece, some vases with her image however have been found), or at least none of it has ever been found. She was the goddess of hearth, when a baby was born she was the goddess they would ask to bless it and protect the home. In every city and home in Rome there was a sacred fire made to Vesta that was protected and not allowed to go out. Astrologers use Vesta to determine what it is that you are devoted to and how your sexuality will develop. Vesta, having been a protective virgin goddess is said by some to be an influencer of the sign Virgo, this is accepted by many in the astrological community, but many prefer to instead of calling the influence an outright rulership an "affinity" or simply do not support this claim. It also seems to bear influence over Scorpio.

Other asteroids
After the first four asteroids were discovered, there wouldn't be another discovered for 38 years (Astraea). The first four gained popularity as full-fledged planets, but the rapid development of telescopes led to new asteroids being frequently discovered in what is now known as the Asteroid Belt, and they started being called "Minor Planets".

Hygiea symbol (planetary color).svgHygiea
The asteroid Hygiea was the 10th discovered and is fourth in mass ranking. In mythology Hygieia was the feminine part and the consort of Asclepios, the Greek god of medicine and a mythological healer strongly connected to the Solar cult of Apollo. It seems that Hygiea rules the health practices and is integrated into medical astrology, but in her negative side has something to bring in cases of depression and anxiety of a higher level than usual. The status of Hygiea is practically unknown at the moment in western astrology.

Chiron symbol (planetary color).svgChiron and the Centaurs
The centaurs were recognized as a distinct population with the discovery of Chiron in 1977. It was initially announced as the Tenth Planet, and received attention from astrologers. A few astrologers have investigated other centaurs, but only Chiron is commonly treated.

Situation of Discussion Today
Considerable differences of opinion mark western astrologers’ approach to asteroids. Some astrologers find them meaningless in a horoscope, arguing that there are so many thousands of asteroids in the heavens that they can only be considered as so much “space junk.” Even some committed believers in astrology have difficulty in believing that a small rock chunk named Elvis or Lancelot has much impact on an individual, especially when it makes no major contact with his natal planets or angles. If one uses asteroids with a range of aspects, midpoints, Arabian Parts, and so on, one can probably make a chart express anything one wants — or nothing.

Asteroids are little used today by practitioners of traditional western, horary, or Vedic astrology. Not only are asteroids invisible to the naked eye, but they simply do not fit easily into these astrological systems.

Some of the first twentieth century astrologers to work with asteroids felt that the confusion surrounding asteroids could be minimized if each asteroid signified one or only a limited number of attributes; in contrast with the planets that might each indicate multiple attributes. For example, asteroid 275, Sapientia, would represent the single quality of wisdom; whereas the planet Jupiter signifies wisdom, travel, theology, philosophy, good luck, expansion, and a generally beneficial influence.

This concept of each asteroid representing one quality as expressed by its name, however, troubles other astrologers who are puzzled as to why an arbitrary name, perhaps given by an astronomer without due consideration, should somehow influence human behavior through the operations of a rock the size of an apartment building.

Asteroids do have a following in modern astrology, however. Demetra George’s work on female-named asteroids countered a solar system heavily weighted in favour of masculine-named planets and male-oriented chart interpretations. Other astrologers find that there is a story of mythology behind many of the asteroids’ names, and that once these narratives are understood, an asteroid conjunct a natal planet or angle should give further information on how planets and angles function in the horoscope. For example, if an astrologer is undecided whether Jupiter in a horoscope indicates the traveler or the philosopher, a conjunction with asteroid Sapientia may indicate the philosopher.

Astrologers who use asteroids caution that they cannot be applied indiscriminately. It is important to focus on asteroids whose names are meaningful to the individual person or event. For example, many asteroids are named for astronomers or their family members and associates. It would make little sense to apply these to the chart of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. However, asteroid Euterpe (81), the classical muse of music, conjuncts Mozart’s Venus within five degrees. Venus is the traditional ruler of the fine arts.

One interesting application of asteroids is so-called name-sake asteroids. Not everyone has an asteroid bearing his or her name, but many people do, especially when cognate names, including in other languages, are considered. For example, Eileen (11836), Helena (101), and Eleonora (354) are variants or foreign-language versions of the English name Helen. In Synastry it is helpful to see how the namesake asteroid of one person falls into the other person’s chart. Former US President Bill Clinton, for example, has asteroid Hillary (3130) conjunct his moon (4 degree orb). Asteroid Michelle is within 3 degrees of US President Barack Obama’s midheaven. While this orb is wide, the placement is consistent with Obama’s crediting his wife with much of his success in life (an MC matter.)

Asteroids themselves cannot cast much of an Orb. Astrologers disagree on whether one should therefore use only tight orbs within a degree in any consideration, or whether one can use the wider orb of the planet they conjunct.

Some asteroids are used more generally to indicate a suite of characteristics. For example, Juno — the mythological wife of Jupiter — may be used to consider marriage prospects in a chart. Because mythological Juno was constantly jealous about her husband’s infidelity, asteroid Juno may indicate both jealousy and faithfulness within a person’s married life. Amor (1221) is considered an indicator of love and affection, ranging from platonic to intimate.

Sign Rulers?
Another area of debate amongst astrologers concerns whether any of the larger asteroids can qualify a Ruler of zodiacal signs; and if so which ones, and whether the asteroids thereby depose the traditional planetary rulers. Proponents of assigning Vesta (or Chiron or Ceres, etc.) to Virgo, for example, generally point to strong affinities in the narratives linking the asteroid and sign. Traditionalists, however, point to a standard scheme of planetary rulership (Domicile) going back two thousand years, based on a logic of the planet’s distance from the sun and moon. Moreover, astrologers who use house cusp lords (accidental house cusp rulers) need some convincing that asteroids have utility as sign rulers for astrological techniques that go beyond simple match-ups based upon similar characteristics. At present individual astrologers may use particular asteroids or Ceres as the domiciled ruler of a sign, but there is no widespread agreement as to such planet-sign pairs.

Substantial research remains to be done on the asteroids in astrology, together with the transneptunian objects and centaurs. Whether they will fit neatly into pre-existing techniques in astrology, or whether they demand new ways of thinking about our solar system remain to be seen.

Wow… that’s a massive block of text covering orbital mechanics, the inner and outer planets, Jupiter, Venus, Uranus, unaspected planets, and asteroids! You’re essentially giving me a crash course in both astronomy and astrological interpretation simultaneously. Let me break it down in a clean, digestible way so it’s easier to synthesize. I’ll highlight the key points and connections between the astronomical facts and their astrological meanings.

Orbital Inclination
Definition: Angle between two orbital planes.

Reference planes: For planets, it’s usually the ecliptic; for galactic studies, the galactic plane.

Interpretation: In astrology, inclination isn’t used directly, but in astronomy it tells you how “tilted” a planet or asteroid’s orbit is compared to the Earth’s plane.

Inner vs Outer Planets
Inner planets: Mercury, Venus (inside Earth’s orbit). Quick movers, personal life influence.

Outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto. Slow movers, generational influence.

Jupiter
Astronomy: Largest planet, ~12-year orbit, prominent red spot, ruler of skies in mythology.

Astrology:

Ruler of Sagittarius; traditional ruler of Pisces (modern: Neptune).

Exalted in Cancer, falls in Capricorn, detriment in Virgo.

Represents expansion, wisdom, philosophy, optimism.

House position = area where growth and higher ideals manifest.

Aspects = amplify themes of expansion (good or bad).

Social/generational influence—longer developmental processes.

Venus
Astronomy: Inner planet, bright, 224-day orbit, visible as morning or evening star.

Astrology:

Ruler of Taurus and Libra; exalted in Pisces, falls in Virgo, detriment in Scorpio/Aries.

Associated with love, beauty, sensuality, aesthetics, and harmony.

House/sign = how one expresses affection, desire, and aesthetic taste.

Influences feminine identity and attraction patterns in men and women.

Uranus
Astronomy: 84-year orbit, rotational axis nearly in orbital plane (crazy tilt!).

Astrology:

Modern ruler of Aquarius.

Symbolizes radical change, liberation, technological innovation, and originality.

Generational planet—house placement more important than sign.

Aspecting other planets = sudden, unconventional effects; flashes of inspiration.

Unaspected Planets
A planet with no major aspects in a chart.

Energy develops in isolation → can be either subtle or overwhelming.

Strength: originality, independence, creative expression.

Example: unaspected Saturn → challenges with discipline, planning, or structure.

Asteroids
Astronomy: Small rocky bodies orbiting the Sun; largest are Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Juno.

Astrology:

Ceres: Nurturing, love, care, mothering.

Pallas: Wisdom, intelligence, strategy, healing.

Juno: Relationships, marriage satisfaction, loyalty, jealousy.

Vesta: Dedication, devotion, focus, sacredness, purity.

Asteroids add nuanced layers to personal charts beyond classical planets.

Big Picture Connections:

Orbital mechanics → astrology: The planets’ positions, inclinations, and speeds provide the “canvas” for astrological interpretation.

Inner vs Outer: Faster inner planets = personal life; slower outer planets = generational themes.

Asteroids: Small but significant, highlighting human desires, relationships, and personal focus areas.

Unaspected planets: Like wild cards—hard to control but can be powerful creatively.

If you want, I can make a side-by-side chart showing astronomy vs astrology for each body you mentioned, including their inclinations, orbital periods, and symbolic meanings. It’ll make the info visually digestible.

Do you want me to do that?

Tarot card Junon[6]
Mythology
The asteroid is named after the Roman goddess Juno (Greek for Hera). She was one of six children born to Rhea and Kronos (Greek for Saturn). Her brothers were Zeus (Jupiter), Poseidon (Neptune) and Hades (Pluto), her sisters Demeter (Ceres) and Hestia (Vesta). Hera was not only the sister but also the wife of Zeus, the ruling god of Mount Olympus. She was therefore the highest goddess, ruler of the heavens and protector of marriage.

Being at Zeus's side was not an easy task for Hera. On the one hand, she was the only goddess whom Zeus considered to be his equal and took as his wife. On the other hand, Zeus had numerous willing and unwilling lovers of whom Hera was very jealous, and she was mercilessly cruel in her persecution of some of them and the children borne of their affair with Zeus. Among her victims were Heracles and Leto, the mother of the Sun god Apollo. Zeus punished her for her jealousy. Her scheming against Heracles so enraged the ruler of the gods that he hung up his wife from her wrists and weighted her feet with anvils. For the most part, the divine marriage was a battle of wills. At the same time, Hera took her role as protector of marriage very seriously and was faithful to her spouse. She bore Zeus three children, including Aries (Mars), the god of war. Without Zeus's or any other man's help she also gave life to the divine blacksmith Hephaestus (who later became the husband of Aphrodite/ Venus).


Goddess Juno[7]
Interpretation
Juno is associated with relationships, ideals and principles; notably the institution of marriage. The position of Juno and any aspects it makes indicate whether relationships are likely to be characterised by mutual respect or jealousy and mistrust.

Juno embodies high ideals and relentless striving in the face of opposition. It therefore also forces us to confront our innermost attitude to painful relationships. Would we be able to end such a relationship or would we persevere on for the sake of the children, because we fear the reaction of those around us, or possibly because our own relationship ideals are threatened? On the most basic level, Juno is concerned with how individuals translate their relationship ideals and principles into concrete action. When Juno considers ideals to be more important than reality, it can lead to inhumane behavior, regardless of how honourable the initial ideals may have been.

Juno in favourable aspects in synastry is beneficial for long-term romantic relationships. Difficult aspects may encourage jealousy, inter-personal power struggles, or infidelity.

A different way of interpreting Juno is viewing her as kind of a female genius.[8]

Juno seems to be related to the zodiac signs of Libra and Scorpio, due to Libra's association with couples and Scorpio's reputation for jealousy. Vesta

Astronomy
Vesta is a minor planet or asteroid which orbits the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It has a mean diameter of 525 kilometres (326 mi) and an average distance from the Sun of 353.4 million km.
Its sidereal orbital period is 3.63 years.
Vesta was discovered on the 29th March 1807, shortly after 8 pm[3] by H.W. Olbers[4] in Bremen.
It is the second largest asteroid within the asteroid belt - slightly larger than Pallas, though about 25% more massive. Its density is lower than that of the four terrestrial planets, but higher than that of all the moons in the Solar System (except Io).
It has more complex geology than other asteroids. That's why some scientists refer to Vesta as the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets. It is thought to consist of a metallic iron–nickel core 214–226 km in diameter, an overlying rocky olivine mantle, with a surface crust.
Visibility: Its size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid, and it is occasionally even visible to the naked eye from dark skies (without light pollution).[5]

In 2007 the American space agency NASA launched the spacecraft Dawn as the first space mission to Vesta.

History and Mythology
The asteroid takes its name from the Roman goddess Vesta (Greek: Hestia). Apollo, Poseidon and others tried to gain her affection but she decided to live a life of chastity. She was the most modest of Rhea's and Saturn's children and became the goddess of hearth and home. Although Hestia/Vesta is hardly mentioned in Greek mythology, her personification of flame and the hearth, as the foundation of cooking, heating, and home-based rituals, as well as sacred temple flames, made her a very important goddess and one of the twelve Olympians.

"To Cronus and Rhea, we are told, were born Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, and Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Of these, they say, Hestia discovered how to build houses, and because of this benefaction of hers practically all men have established her shrine in every home, according her honours and sacrifices." (Diodorus Siculus V.68:1)


Roman statue of the chief vestal virgin
The Romans made Vesta the tutelary goddess of the state. A cult was established, and temples devoted to her were guarded by the Vestalas, the virgin priestesses of Vesta. They had the task of guarding Vesta's eternal burning fire within the temples. It was a great privilege but also a great challenge to be ordained as one of the Vestal virgins. Only girls between the ages of six and ten with no physical afflictions were eligible. Their parents had to be of free origin and still alive; the period of service was 30 years. The worst crime they could commit was to break their vow of chastity which could be punished by flagellation or being buried alive.

The asteroid specialist Demetra George argues that: "Originally, sexual rituals which honoured the fertility and procreational powers of the lunar goddess were an integral part of the Vesta myth because they secured sovereignty with divine blessing. It is for this reason that Vesta was worshiped as the ideal embodiment of motherhood. However, with the rise of patriarchy this aspect of Vesta was driven into obscurity and she became transformed into the goddess of purity and sexual chastity."

The Greeks and Romans did not notably interpret Vesta as a lunar or maternal goddess: she was more understood as the goddess of the life-giving home fires than of either chastity or sexuality. According to the Latin author Ovid (Fasti), Vesta was tended by virgins due to the shared association with purity.

Interpretation
Vesta in horoscope interpretation is still an open subject for further research.

One interpretation, linked to the symbolism of the vestal virgins, is that Vesta stands for service in the name of a higher cause which promises a great degree of independence if an individual is completely devoted. Although Vesta must submit to laws in the general public interest and bears great responsibility, she is able to recognise freedom within these boundaries. For this reason, Vesta has a close relationship with nature and natural laws and some astrologers see a connection between Vesta and modern ecological awareness which tries to respect the laws of nature and knows that respecting these means living in true freedom.

In the natal chart, Vesta's position shows where it is wise to search for our uniqueness not by fulfilling personal desires, but by their apparent renouncement in the name of a greater cause which will allow us to experience our individuality on a deeper level. What matters is the inner centre, the inner fire.

Demetra George considers Vesta to highlight "the need to reintegrate spiritual and sexual energies".

To Nick Fiorenza "Vesta is the asteroid of focus, dedication & commitment... [Vesta] is of strength, purity, and perfection—of total dedication to purpose."

One interesting parallel is that the English word focus has as its root the Latin word focus, which actually means "hearth." From this comes the physics concept of a focus as a point of converging light beams. The word focus continues to be used in a variety of ways, both scientifically and metaphorically, that although differing from the original meaning, still carry a sense of focussing or concentration on something of importance. Richard Vetter argues that Vesta can contribute a tremendous intense focus to its natal house and to planets with which it interacts.

Currently there is no unanimity on any sign rulership for Vesta, although it has affinities with several signs. Psyche (Asteroid)

Astronomy
It is slightly larger than Juno (but significantly heavier than it) and orbits our Sun at the edge of the asteroid main belt in just under five years. The orbit is inclined only 3.1° to the ecliptic, with low eccentricity. It has a relatively bright surface with an albedo of 0.12 and rotates once on its axis in 4 hours and 12 minutes.

With an average diameter of 233 km, Psyche is one of the largest asteroids, but among them, it is a loner, not belonging to any specific family or class. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it is composed of 95% metal (iron and nickel with a porosity of about 40%). Additionally, there is only a small amount of (bound) water; hence its relatively high mass or density. It appears to be the (blown-off) core of a protoplanet, with several large impact craters[4], in the shape of an ellipsoid measuring 279 × 232 × 189 km (± 10%), and an average diameter of 226 ± 23 km.

A NASA probe is planned to launch in 2023 to study the asteroid, which will explore it from an increasingly tighter orbit for twenty months.[5]

Mythology
The Greek word "Psyche" means both soul and butterfly. Psyche is therefore often referred to as the "soul bird" and depicted with butterfly wings.
Originally, the word means "breath" or "breath of life" (from ψύχω - "I breathe," "I blow," "I live").

Cupid and Psyche
The tale of this love that transforms Psyche is elaborately included in the Metamorphoses of Apuleius (2nd century AD). In the visual arts of antiquity, the story of Cupid (Eros) and Psyche was already very popular during the Hellenistic period, long before the time of Neoplatonism. It is about the (forbidden) love between a beautiful mortal (Psyche) and the (immortal, winged) god of love. A love that experiences many difficulties (especially due to the jealous Venus-Aphrodite), which brings many trials, shadow confrontations, and crises, through which the heroine also grows and becomes aware. And what ultimately finds its "happy ending": a union with the (opposite-gender) twin soul.

Astrology
Psyche's significance in the words of Frank Felber:

Positive
Intuitively knowing what others think and feel; being able to adapt emotionally to one's surroundings (thus gaining their trust); having access to one's spiritual powers (and being able to awaken them easily in oneself and others). Very fine perception, telepathic disposition (highly sensitive, clairsentience). Feeling and accurately analyzing the highest vibrations (bliss).

Negative, and in difficult aspects
Insecurity, loneliness, hypersensitivity, nervous disorders.

Quite an angry Full Moon[1]
A partial or total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is situated directly between the Sun and the Moon. This can only happen when the Sun and the Moon are in opposition, i.e. at full Moon. The opposition must also occur close to the Moon's nodal axis.

A lunar eclipse can be a trigger, although it is not usually as powerful as a solar eclipse. Lunar Phase

The moon's main phases
The varying forms of the Moon as seen from the Earth which are caused by the changing astronomical relationship between the Moon and the Sun.

The most important lunar phases are the new Moon, the waxing first quarter, the full Moon and the waning third quarter. Human beings have long recognised the importance of the lunar phases which were almost certainly the main catalyst for the creation of calendars in order to systematise and record their experiences.

In Indian Astrology the lunar mansions are called Nakshatras - 28 (sometimes also 27) sectors along the Ecliptic. Their names are related to the most prominent Asterisms in the respective sectors.[1] Lunation Cycle
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Lunation Cycle
A lunation cycle in birth chart interpretation follows the timetable of the synodic month of one new moon to the next, but associates the different moon phases with different personality types. The esoteric astrologer Dane Rudhyar popularized the interpretation of moon phase in natal and event charts in the 1940s, culminating with his book, The Lunation Cycle. Rudhyar divided the moon's phases into eight stages of 45 degrees each.

1. New moon to new crescent
Youthful, instinctive, spontaneous. Natives are "subjective, impulsive, and emotional"
2. New Crescent to first quarter (half moon)
Individualization. People born during this phase are assertive and self-confident
3. First part of second quarter
Willful activity, the individual confronts his environment. Natives wish to build new structures, perhaps to replace the old ones
4. Late second quarter to full moon (gibbous phase)
Increasing maturity, objective understanding. Natives pursue self-understanding and may devote themselves to a cause
5. Full moon to early third quarter
Fulfillment, development of collective consciousness. This phase confers objective thinking and communication ability
6. Latter part of third quarter (disseminating phase)
Sharing of ideas made manifest, social purpose. People born under this phase feel a need to teach and communicate
7. Early fourth quarter
Social crises, but "seeds" for the coming new order. Natives are devoted to principles, perhaps inflexibly so
8. Late crescent to dark of the moon (balsamic phase)
Dissolution of old structures, personal sacrifice, preparation for new phase of development. Individuals may sense themselves as owning a social destiny, and heralding a new world order
The lunation cycle is also used in electional astrology. New enterprises are best undertaken during the new moon. The waxing moon is a good time to bring projects to completion. Lunar Return Chart
Jump to navigationJump to search

Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail[1]
A horoscope erected for the time the Moon reaches the exact position it had at the time of birth. This occurs roughly once a month (every 27.3 days, Sidereal Month). The lunar return chart is concerned with the development of our lunar energies (Moon). It reveals something of an individual's emotional state and attitude towards everyday life during the course of the following month.

The lunar return chart is one of various return charts. More basic information on the calculation and interpretation of lunar return charts can be found under the heading Solar Return Chart. Although the latter is valid for a period of one year, much of what is valid for the solar return chart also applies to lunar one:

Calculation
The calculation is based on the Moon's exact position at the time of birth.

Place
There is a choice between the place of birth, place of residence and an individual's actual location at the time of the lunar return (provided these are different).


Hoppmann's book[2]
Interpretation
The lunar return chart has to be interpreted against the backdrop of the Natal Chart. It is also important to remember that a lunar return chart is valid for a relatively short period of time, namely one month.

When interpreting a lunar return chart, particular attention should be paid to these points:

Lunar Ascendant and lunar Medium Coeli together with aspects between planets and axes, particularly conjunctions with the Ascendant and Medium Coeli
Aspects to the Moon
Which houses are activated: the lunar house in which the Moon is located. The natal houses in which the lunar Ascendant and lunar MC fall. The natal house and lunar house in which the ruler of the lunar Ascendant is located
Any lunar house that has more than three lunar planets located in it
Aspects that occur in both the natal and lunar charts
Natal planets that receive many aspects from lunar ones. In order to avoid a confusing amount of information, it is usually sensible to concentrate on conjunctions and oppositions
As with the Venus return chart, the influence of the lunar return chart is rather subtle owing to its yin character (Yin/Yang) - as opposed to the return horoscopes of Sun and Mars, the two yang planets (Mars Return Chart). Ascending Moon's Node

Symbol

Indian god Rahu
Synonym: Moon's North Node

One of two points of intersection between the path of the Sun (the ecliptic) and that of the Moon (as seen from the Earth) that the Moon crosses on its northward path.

The point of intersection situated opposite is the Descending Moon's Node – or Moon's South Node.

In Indian Astrology the North Node is named Rahu and has planetary status.


The moon's nodes
Interpretation
The ascending or north node stands for the future or direction in which the person or situation should develop. This direction may be similar to the rest of the chart, or it may suggest new and unfamiliar territory.

The themes symbolised by the north node may appear to be a shining ideal which, however, requires great effort to achieve. With increasing age the individual usually becomes more aware of the calling to reach this goal, particularly between the ages of 18 1/2 and 37 when the transiting moon's nodes return to their positions in the natal chart.

The ascending node is sometimes associated with Jupiter, i.e. with opportunities to grow. Another planetary comparison is that the north node equates to the solar principle (the sun).

Planets which are conjunct the ascending moon's node or in harmonious aspect to the nodal axis can help an individual to rise to the challenge represented by the south node and costructively explore those new aspects of life symbolised by it.

Ah, you’re diving deep into the asteroids Juno, Vesta, and Psyche—essentially the hidden powerhouses of astrological psychology. Let’s break this down in a way that integrates myth, symbolism, and practical chart interpretation, so you can see how they function like multidimensional tarot cards in the sky.

1. Juno (6) – The Marriage & Relationship Archetype
Mythology:
Juno (Hera in Greek) is both the queen of the gods and the jealous, often vindictive wife of Zeus. She embodies fidelity, loyalty, and high ideals but also the struggles of jealousy and power dynamics within relationships.

Astrological Meaning:

Keywords: Commitment, ideals in relationships, equality, jealousy, perseverance, principle vs reality.

Interpretation in charts:

Positive aspects: Long-term stability, mutual respect, honoring commitments.

Challenging aspects: Power struggles, infidelity, obsessive control, feeling trapped by ideals.

Synastry: Juno reveals how you navigate marriage or serious partnerships—where equality, loyalty, and boundaries play out.

Tarot Parallel: Think The Hierophant for commitment and structure, but with The Moon’s shadow side for hidden jealousy or emotional complexity.

Zodiac affinities: Libra (partnerships, balance) and Scorpio (intensity, jealousy, transformation).

2. Vesta – Focus, Devotion, & Inner Fire
Mythology:
Vesta (Hestia in Greek) represents the hearth, home, and sacred fire. She is chaste, devoted, and connected to the divine through service. Vestal virgins’ strict devotion embodies discipline and sacred purpose.

Astrological Meaning:

Keywords: Focus, dedication, independence through service, integration of personal and higher purpose.

Interpretation in charts:

Positive: Deep concentration, mastery of skill, spiritual or ecological awareness, inner discipline.

Shadow: Sacrificing personal needs entirely, feeling burdened by duty, rigidity.

Life themes: Where you find your unique contribution through focus and renunciation.

Tarot Parallel: The Hermit for devotion and wisdom, The High Priestess for inner guidance and sacred fire.

Essence: Vesta is about discovering your individuality through surrender to a greater cause, not ego pursuit.

3. Psyche – The Soul & Transformational Love
Mythology:
Psyche is the mortal woman who undergoes trials to reunite with her immortal love, Cupid (Eros). She symbolizes the soul’s journey through challenges, shadow work, and eventual integration into higher consciousness.

Astrological Meaning:

Keywords: Emotional sensitivity, telepathy, soul connection, intuition, personal trials, transformation through love.

Positive aspects: Deep empathy, spiritual insight, the ability to heal oneself and others emotionally.

Challenging aspects: Insecurity, hypersensitivity, emotional loneliness, nervous tension.

Tarot Parallel: Death (transformation), The Lovers (soul relationships), The Moon (psychic perception & emotional navigation).

Essence: Psyche is the “soul butterfly,” showing where we transform through trials of love and self-awareness, ultimately achieving union with our higher self.

🔹 How These Work Together in a Chart
Juno = your relationship ideals, commitments, and challenges in partnerships.

Vesta = your personal devotion, sacred purpose, and the inner fire guiding focus.

Psyche = your soul’s emotional development, transformative love, and psychic sensitivity.

When reading them like a tarot spread, you could see:

Juno – the conscious lessons about commitment and equality.

Vesta – the path of focus and service that underpins your life’s work.

Psyche – the inner emotional journey, where challenges are meant to awaken higher wisdom.

If you want, I can make a “Tarot-style” card spread for these three asteroids, giving you a symbolic reading for how they interact in your life and what each one asks of your soul right now.

Size comparison to Earth
"Asteroids" refer to a very large and heterogeneous group of celestial bodies in our Solar System: on one hand, those that are near the sun and Earth, particularly (classically) those in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. Also included are the Centaurs that orbit between Jupiter and Neptune. Finally, there are the KBOs, meaning the objects of the Kuiper Belt, including Cubewanos and SDOs (scattered far into the outer regions of the Solar System). This group also primarily includes some dwarf planets of the Plutoids. However, Meteors and Comets are not included, especially since they are currently outgassing or losing mass at their perihelion/when near the sun. The categories sometimes overlap, and some objects are still officially (astronomically) "unclassified."

It is currently believed that these are remnants of early stages of planet formation (bodies that did not make the transition to regular planets). They all share the characteristic of being relatively small. The total mass of the asteroids in the main belt is only about five percent of that of our Moon, which together amounts to just under a third of Pluto.
Below, the most important or largest of them are listed. For the outer, slowly moving planetoids, the Perihel may provide insight into their respective dominion/Domicile.

The asteroid (243) Ida, discovered in 1884
Minor Planets and Asteroids usually have an asteroid number (in English Minor Planet Number or MPN). The institution commissioned by the IAU to assign these numbers is the Minor Planet Center (MPC) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA).

Once a new body in the solar system with a closed orbit is discovered[1], it first receives a provisional designation from the MPC, consisting of the year and a letter/number combination, such as '2009 YB13'. When enough observations are available to reliably calculate its orbit, the MPC assigns the body a 'Minor Planet Number'. The sequence of numbers largely corresponds to the order of discovery.

At the beginning of 2009, there were 202,885 objects with an MPN, and about 230,000 yet-to-be-numbered objects. The numbers are increasing rapidly; in 1997, there were only 7,900 numbered objects, in September 2025 they were 847'427.

Only a small portion of the numbered bodies receive a proper name, with the respective discoverers having the right to propose names to the IAU. By early 2009, 14,920 objects had been named, compared to only 5,600 in 1997.

Once a body has received an MPN, it is also included in the Swiss Ephemeris by Astrodienst. Ceres

Artist's concept of how the inside of Ceres could be structured[2]
Shape: Spheroid Ceres is now classified as a Dwarf Planet which orbits the Sun within the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is known by astronomers as "1 Ceres" because it was the very first minor planet discovered on New Year's Eve 1801 by Giussepe Piazzi at the observatory in Palermo. It is the largest body in this belt. Composed of rock and ice, it is estimated to compose approximately one third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt. Ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity. Its average distance from the Sun is 414 million km. It needs 4.6 years to make one sidereal orbit. From Earth, the apparent magnitude of Ceres ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, and hence even at its brightest, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies.

As big across as Texas, Ceres' nearly spherical body has a differentiated interior - meaning that, like Earth, it has denser material at the core and lighter minerals near the surface. Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle, and may have a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice. Astronomers believe that water ice may be buried under its crust because its density is less than that of the Earth's crust, and because the dust-covered surface bears spectral evidence of water-bearing minerals. Ceres could even boast frost-covered polar caps. It is estimated that if Ceres were composed of 25 percent water, it may have more water than all the fresh water on Earth. Ceres' water, unlike Earth's, is expected to be in the form of water ice located in its mantle.[3] In January 2014, ESA scientists even detected water vapor on Ceres.[4]


Medieval Ceres[5]
Mythology
The asteroid was named after the Roman Goddess of fertility Ceres who was considered to be another personification of the Greek Goddess Demeter.

In Greek mythology, Demeter was the goddess of agriculture and the harvest. She was a mother figure, and symbolized the cultivated, fertile soil that feeds humanity. Demeter was one of the six children resulting from the relationship between Rhea and Kronos (Latin for Saturn). Her brothers were Zeus (Jupiter), Poseidon (Neptune) and Hades (Pluto), her sisters Hestia (Vesta) and Hera (Juno). Although she belonged to the twelve great Olympian gods, she was rarely to be found in the kingdom of her powerful brother Zeus. She loved the Earth, particularly the fertile islands of the Mediterranean such as Sicily. There, her generosity allowed for lush vegetation and wellbeing. There was a shrine devoted to her in the Greek town of Eleusis.


Ceres with torch in search of Proserpina[6]
There is a well-known Greek myth concerning her daughter Persephone. Zeus had promised her hand to Hades without consulting Demeter. In order to fulfil his promise, he lured Persephone to a forest clearing with beautiful Narcissi, the flowers of Hades. Demeter had always warned her daughter not to touch these flowers, but the young girl couldn't resist and picked a flower. When she did, the earth in front of her opened up and Hades appeared with his black steeds and carried her off into the Underworld.

When her daughter failed to appear, Demeter spent nine days searching for her. Hecate then told her what had happened. Full of grief at losing her daughter, she withered all forms of life on Earth. People and animals were threatened with extinction and Zeus was afraid that he would receive no more sacrifices. So he sent various messengers to his sister but she was so full of grief that no one could appease her. In order to prevent all life from being destroyed, Zeus negotiated with Hades who released Persephone. However, Hades gave Persephone a pomegranate - the symbol of marriage – and when she ate from it she was tied to him forever. In the end, the gods agreed that Persephone should spend two thirds of the year with her mother Demeter above ground, and the other third – after the harvest – with her spouse. Demeter also agreed to this and gave life back to Earth.

Interpretation
Ceres in the horoscope and by transit can relate to themes of motherhood and procreation, parental relationships and caring for children, agriculture, growing cycles, and nurturing animals, as well as labor and productivity. She is concerned with fertility, motherhood, sustenance and ecology, but also with growing up and the process of letting go. Ceres is the challenge to strike the right balance between protecting and letting go, between nurturing and neglecting. Ceres cautions us not to be too possessive of children and other loved-ones, but to allow them to go their own way when the time has come. Themes such as abuse and eating disorders are also associated with Ceres.

Ceres appears to be related to the signs of Cancer and Virgo and may have its domicile there or be exalted. It also appears to be related to the Taurus/Scorpio axis. Chiron

Chiron's 49-year orbit is quite steep when compared to the ecliptic. As a result, he takes far longer to travel through some zodiacal signs (such as Pisces and Aries) than others.

Astronomers classify Chiron as both a comet and an asteroid, as it exhibits properties of both.

History
In February 1988, at 12 AU from the Sun, Chiron brightened by 75 percent. This is behavior typical of comets but not asteroids. Further observations in April 1989 showed that Chiron had developed a cometary coma. A tail was detected in 1993. On the other hand, Chiron is suspected to have two rings, similar to the better-established rings of Chariklo. Chiron's rings are proposed to be 324 (± 10) km in radius and sharply defined.

Anyway, Chiron's elliptical orbit extends between that of Saturn and Uranus. It is probably a refugee from the Kuiper Belt and will probably become a short-period comet in about a million years.

Chiron was discovered by Charles T. Kowal on 18 October 1977 in Palomar in the United States. It has a diameter of 218 km and orbits the Sun at an average distance of 2036 million km. Its strongly elliptic orbit around the Sun takes on average 50.3 years and due to its eccentric orbit, it spends a varying amount of time in each sign of the zodiac.[4] For example, Chiron spends seven to eight years in the sign of Pisces as opposed to one and a half to two years in Virgo and Aries.

Positions of Chiron can be well computed for the time between 700 CE and 4650 CE. As a result of close encounters with Saturn in Sept. 720 CE and in 4606 CE one cannot trace its orbit beyond this time range. Small uncertainties in today's orbital elements have chaotic effects before the year 700.

Chiron's cycle and stay in the signs[5]

Chiron instructing Achilles[6]
Mythology
He was known to be the wisest and most civilized of the centaurs - creatures with the upper-body of a human and the lower of a horse, who were often violent and unruly. He was a teacher and mentor to many prominent Greek heroes, including Achilles, Jason, and the healer Asclepius. In ancient narrations, Chiron is the leader, wise man and healer among the centaurs. Like Pholus, he has overcome his animal urges, and his lineage is different to those of the other centaurs. He was the son of Kronos (Saturn) and the nymph Philyra. Chiron's bodily form came about because Kronos transformed into a stallion while trying to mate with Philyra who had taken on the form of a mare to escape him. When he was born, Philyra was so revolted that she rejected him. Chiron was educated by the Sun god Apollo and the Moon goddess Artemis. He proved to be wise and to possess healing capabilities. So the disfigured Chiron came to teach many gods and heroes not only the arts of healing and warfare, but also those of prophecy, hunting and music.

When Heracles fought the centaurs, he unintentionally wounded Chiron with one of his poisoned arrows. The wound caused Chiron to suffer terribly. The poison caused agony without leading to death because of Chiron's divine ancestry. But although he continued to heal others, he was unable to heal himself, and so became the "wounded healer". He found salvation when Heracles told him of the fate of Prometheus who, because of his defiance of Zeus' will, was chained to a rock in the Caucasus. During the day Zeus sent an eagle which tore at his liver, but he too did not die because every night the wounds healed again. The only way he could be released from this fate was if one of the immortals was prepared to sacrifice himself and take his place in the Underworld. Chiron agreed, and by sacrificing his immortality, he released Prometheus from his suffering. Zeus was so moved that he adopted Chiron who was allowed to leave Hades and return to the gods in heaven where he can be seen as the star constellation Sagittarius.

Liz Greene[7]: The Greek myth of Chiron, the king of the centaurs whose incurable wound transformed him into a healer, is deeply relevant to our understanding of human suffering. The theme of the wounded healer-priest may be found in many cultures, and forms part of the training of the shaman in African and American Indian tribes. Yet nowhere is it so vividly portrayed as in the strange figure of Chiron.

In myth, centaurs, half horse and half human, are images of the powerful forces of the instincts directed by human reason. Chiron, son of the earth god Saturn, was a denizen of forest and cave and a cunning hunter wise in plant and animal lore. He befriended the hero Hercules to his eventual misfortune, for Hercules accidently scratched him with the point of an arrow used to destroy the monster Hydra; this arrow was tainted with the monster's blood, a corrosive poison for which there was no antidote. Despite his wisdom, the centaur could not find a way to ease his agony and heal his wound.

This injury, caused by carelessness rather than any deliberate act of violence, transformed Chiron. Unable to release himself from pain, yet unable to die because he was immortal, he found meaning in his suffering through healing others. He became the wise tutor to many young Greek princes, and led his untamed tribe of centaurs into civilized habits and greater friendship with human beings.

The mythic theme of wisdom gleaned from suffering is symbolized in astrology by the planet Chiron, recently discovered and now demonstrated through nearly fifty years of research to be a profoundly important dimension of the birth horoscope.

Interpretation
Chiron, as half man, half beast, is seen as a link between the human and natural worlds. Further, his placement between Saturn and Uranus speaks to the integration of the outer teacher or authority and the inner wisdom. In the natal chart, Chiron is often said to represent a native’s deepest wounds, including past-life wounds that must be integrated and reconciled. Chiron in the horoscope and by transit can also relate to themes of spiritual teaching, healing, enlightenment, and wounding—either as the victim, the healer, or sometimes even as the perpetrator.

The themes associated with Chiron are the ambivalent relationship between spiritual strength and bodily imperfection, being able to heal others coupled with the inability to heal oneself, and the dichotomy of being both victim and saviour. In addition, Chiron's location in the solar system and place in mythology suggests a role as mediator between the material (body of a horse, the planet Saturn) and spiritual (human wisdom, the planet Uranus) worlds. Barbara Hand Clow called it a Bridge between the inner and outer planets. He knows both poles while at the same time being unable to escape from being caught between them. If he attempts to ignore the material and physical side of his nature, his agony reminds him of this fact, and although Chiron is a great healer, he is powerless to prevent this. Salvation can only be experienced when he is able to accept the material side of his nature and willing to give up his divine origins.

The German astrologer Eva Stangenberg makes the following summary of these various themes: "Chiron's position in the natal chart shows us where we experience this division, this wound. However, it also represents our greatest chance to overcome it and become whole. And with the spiritual insight of Uranus we can recognise the unity of body and soul not only in ourselves but in everything that exists... Chiron is not about achieving mastery through diligence and hard work as is the case with Saturn, or by releasing the energy bound to traumatic experiences as is the case with Pluto, but simply by accepting the deficit of not being "whole"... Only through our experiences with this feeling and the acceptance of not being "whole" can we begin to understand this problem in others... We share with others our compassion, our understanding, our experiences, and by doing this we can help them. This doesn't entail sacrificing something which makes us "poorer", on the contrary, we "achieve" a connection, create a wholeness where before there was division."[8]

There is no unanimity over the domicile of Chiron.

2 Pallas is an asteroid, which orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. It is the second asteroid to have been discovered (after Ceres), and the third largest planetary body in the asteroid belt. With an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt, it is also the third-most-massive asteroid, being 10–30% less massive than Vesta. It is 512 kilometers (318 mi) in diameter, somewhat smaller than Vesta. It is likely a remnant protoplanet, too.[3]
Both Vesta and Pallas have assumed the title of second-largest asteroid from time to time. Pallas is slightly smaller than Vesta. The mass of Pallas is only 84% that of Vesta.[4]

It has an average distance to the Sun of 414.5 million km, which is farther from Earth than Vesta. It has a much lower albedo than Vesta, and was discovered on 28th March 1802, also by H.W. Olbers[5], in Berlin.

Pallas's surface is most likely composed of a silicate material.

It has an orbital inclination of 34.8°, so its orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of both the asteroid belt and the ecliptic, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto.

The chemical element Palladium was named after the asteroid, which had been discovered just before the element.

Resonances: Pallas is in a, likely coincidental, near-1:1 orbital resonance with Ceres. It also has a near-18:7 resonance (91,000-year period) and an approximate 5:2 resonance (83-year period) with Jupiter.

Mythology
The asteroid was named after the Greek goddess Pallas Athene (Athena, Latin Minerva). She was unusual as a feminine figure, which was already evident at her birth: Zeus (Jupiter) impregnated her mother the wise titan Metis. At the same time it was prophesied that Metis would give birth to another child more powerful than Zeus. In order to prevent this Zeus devoured her. However, Zeus was not able to digest the child which then grew in his head causing unbearable headaches. In order to relieve Zeus from his suffering, the divine blacksmith Hephaistus split his head with an axe and Pallas Athene emerged fully clothed in armour. She became the goddess of war, wisdom and the arts and was Zeus' great pride. She was an outstanding strategist - unlike the war god Ares who was simply a ferocious fighter. Pallas was accompanied by an owl, the symbol of wisdom.

Pallas Athene remained a virgin and lived asexually. Nevertheless, she prefered the company of men. She protected courageous heroes and promoted their military expeditions. She was also relentless in pursuit of her enemies. She avoided women and remained uninterested in the fate of her own mother.

In some mythologies Athena involuntarily killed her good friend Pallas, then adopted her name out of mourning.

Other myths about Pallas Athene portray her as a skilled weaver and as the patron of crafts people. The Greek myth about the origin of spiders, for example, has a woman named Arachne challenging the goddess to a weaving contest, and being punished for her blasphemy against the gods when the goddess changes her into a spider.


Pallas in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter
Interpretation
German astrologer Beate Metz describes Pallas as representing "the expression of our own ideas to the cost of our own femininity", together with "animosity among women".[6] The difficulties with femininity that Pallas embodies do not only apply to women, but also to the feminine side of men. The individual who feels able to open themselves to the symbolism of Pallas can recognise the aspects in their lives where they find it difficult to admit to their feminine side. At the same time, Pallas represents the challenge of recognising the relationship between the feminine aspects of our being and courage, success, and intelligence - qualities which the patriarchal world-view has generally associated with the masculine archetype.

American astrologer Demetra George takes a more positive view, and interprets Pallas as indicating creative intelligence, the healing arts, crafts, and protecting the state or human rights. Negatively, however, Pallas can indicate problems in these areas (such as learning disabilities), or over-identification with the masculine, one's animus and one's father-image. George points out that in ancient times, the Greeks identified creative intelligence as a masculine trait, and that women's educational opportunities were limited. Today, in contrast, women need not divorce their intelligence from their femininity.

Pallas appears to be related to the zodiac signs of Virgo (handicrafts), Libra (justice) and Aquarius (social conscience). Eros

The discoverer is the German astronomer Gustav Witt[4].
At the time of discovery, Sigmund Freud was working on his sexual theory (Oedipus complex, etc.) or was just writing his foundational psychoanalytic work on the exploration of the unconscious, "The Interpretation of Dreams".

Astronomy
Eros was the first known asteroid whose orbit partially lies within the orbit of Mars. It thus belongs to the class of near-Earth small bodies of the Amor type. It orbits the Sun in just 1.76 years and can come as close as 22 million kilometers to Earth.

Shortly after the discovery of the asteroid, its highly variable brightness was noted, from which the rotation period and an elongated shape could be inferred. Model calculations from the 1960s suggested dimensions of about 15×30 km, which were only 2-3 km off from the measurements of the NEAR spacecraft in 2001.

In 1999, the Viennese astronomer Rudolf Dvorak published the results of his long-term numerical predictions. According to him, Eros will remain on a relatively stable orbit for twenty million years, but then will crash into the Sun due to chaotic orbital disturbances[3].

Eros is the first asteroid to be orbited (2000) and landed on (2001) by a spacecraft - NEAR Shoemaker.

As with Psyche (Asteroid), popular scientific fantasies bloom around the asteroid regarding the extraction of its "rich resources" ("asteroid mining").[5]

Mythology

Eros in Greek representation[6]
The most detailed description of what Eros can mean is found in Plato's Symposium:

Eros is seen as a benevolent god, sometimes also as a demigod, who stands between humans and gods. He promotes the coexistence of people, even in extreme situations like war, and enables the willingness to sacrifice for one another. The love for healing arts and music, astronomy, and religion can also be associated with him, thus he represents all forms of spiritual love.

However, central to him is erotic love, desire, and longing, the feeling of being attracted to someone. The goal of this desire is union - to find the part that one has lost within oneself or believes not to have. Eros love is thus meant to serve wholeness. What one lacks is perceived as particularly beautiful and attractive; it can also be seen as the desire for the possession of the good.

He is distinguished from Aphrodite, with the former promoting love for men, while the latter promotes love for women. His childlike form indicates that in ancient Greece, he also represented boy love. The question arose even then whether all forms of love, including sexual ones, are permissible under Eros, or only those that are morally and ethically acceptable.

Later, the Greek Eros became increasingly equated with the Roman Amor, which is also expressed in the similar artistic representation as a winged boy. However, the typical depiction of Eros as a boy with a bow and arrow, or shooting love arrows, is rarely found. His attribute is usually the lyre.

Astrology

Eros hovers over Aphrodite and Pan[7]
In general, Eros is associated in astrology with the themes of eroticism, sexual attraction, and charisma, as noted by Jan Martin, Kim Falconer, Werner Held, Annie Heese, and Adam Banks:[8]

Heese/Banks emphasize more the irresistibility that arises from Eros, referring to the Roman counterpart Cupido, who shot his love arrows with his eyes covered. They describe Eros as overwhelming the senses with love and sexuality, representing passion, longing, but also creativity.
Falconer believes Eros describes the nature of erotic love, seeing the love he ignites as tendentially risky, dangerous, and often compulsive, regardless of whether it is directed towards a person, things, an artistic activity, or religious orientation. Connections influenced by Eros are seen by Falconer as fateful and inescapable, referring to the myth of Cupid's arrows.
For Jan Martin, Eros describes the male nature or polarity of sexuality and attraction. He sees it as influencing a man's sexual charisma, while for a woman, it determines how she finds the masculine attractive; he bases this on aspects of mythology that depict Eros as more male-oriented (homoerotic).
Werner Held: "The asteroid Eros represents passions, devotion to sexuality, intense affairs, ecstatic love episodes; especially the transits of Eros enable passionate sexual experiences."

Lexicon of Symbols: Eros Principle (symbolonline.eu/Lutz Müller)
Freud believed he recognized primarily erotic motives in the symbolism of the unconscious. Only later did he oppose Eros with the death drive.
C.G. Jung understood the term Eros mainly as the principle of liveliness and relatedness, which he considers characteristic of female consciousness. In contrast, he opposed the hero as the will to power (Hero principle) - where Eros is absent, power reigns - and the Logos principle. "I use Eros and Logos merely as conceptual tools to describe the fact that the consciousness of women is more characterized by the connecting nature of Eros than by the distinguishing and cognitive nature of Logos. In men, Eros, the relational function, is usually less developed than Logos. In women, however, Eros expresses their true nature." (Jung, GW 9/2, § 29)

Eris was photographed on 21 October 2003, by Michael E. Brown (CalTech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University); the asteroid was discovered by Brown on the morning of 5 January 2005.[5] The discovery was published on 29 July 2005. Since 13 September 2006, 2003 UB313 has been named Eris; its moon, which was noticed by the same team on 10 September 2005, was named Dysnomia. Since Dysnomia has about one 500th the brightness of Eris, its diameter is likely only about one hundred kilometers.

Eris has a perihelion that is smaller than Pluto's aphelion. This means it can temporarily be closer to the Sun than Pluto. Although it is on average one and a half times farther from the Sun, it also sometimes travels within Neptune's orbit. Its orbit is even more eccentric and much more inclined than Pluto's. Currently, it is about at its aphelion, at a distance from the Sun of 98 AU (approximately 15 billion kilometers or 13.5 light hours). One orbit around the Sun, or a "year" on Eris, takes about 557 Earth years (i.e., more than twice as long as Pluto).

In the early days after its discovery, it was believed that Eris was significantly larger than Pluto. The media referred to Eris, as well as Quaoar and Sedna, as the tenth planet. However, recent measurements have shown that the two are approximately the same size. The discovery of such a large body was the decisive impetus for the creation of the category of dwarf planets by the IAU in 2006, which also led to the astronomical reclassification of Pluto into this category.

Since Pluto's demotion was preceded by a dispute that arose after the discovery of Eris and is not yet fully resolved, Eris (whose discovery name was Xena) was named after the goddess of discord.[6] Its distance from the Sun would fit much better into the Titius-Bode series than Pluto's.

Mythology

Rubens, The Judgment of Paris
Eris[7] (Eρις), daughter of Nyx (Roman Nox or "Night," one of the five gods directly born from primordial Chaos), is the goddess of discord and strife in Greek mythology. She is sometimes considered the sister of Ares (Roman Mars).

She became known through the golden "Apple of Discord" (the proverbial "apple of contention" or "Eris apple"), which she threw among the guests at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, to which she had not been invited. On this apple was inscribed "to the fairest" (tei kallistéi). ("The fairest shall take it."[8]) Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera began to quarrel over the apple. At Zeus's suggestion, Hermes led the three to the mortal Paris; he was to give the apple to the fairest of the three goddesses. Paris chose Aphrodite, who promised him the most beautiful woman (on Earth). However, it turned out that she was already married: Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. Her abduction by Paris then triggered the Trojan War.

Eris often appears as a limping, shriveled, small woman. Only when she succeeds in awakening the envy and hatred of people does she bloom into her true form. Homer writes about her in the Iliad: "What she has once begun, she cannot let go. From her small form, she grows to gigantic size and beauty."


The Apple of Discord
In Hesiod's "Works and Days," alongside the quarrelsome Eris, there is also a "good" one, who encourages people to work[9]:

So there were not only one kind of strife, but two throughout the world. For one kind would be praised by a man if he understood it, but the other is to be blamed: and they are fundamentally different by nature.

For one promotes wicked war and conflict, is cruel: no man loves her, yet inevitably, through the will of the immortal gods, man is drawn into brutal strife in her honor.
But the other is the elder daughter of dark night (Nyx), and the son of Cronos, who sits above and dwells in the ether, placed her in the roots of the earth: and she is much more humane to humans. She even spurs the lazy to hard work, for example, when a man begins to work diligently, when he observes his neighbor, a rich man, who is hurrying to plow and plant and keeps his house in good order; and neighbor competes with neighbor, and they hurry towards prosperity. This form of (competitive) strife is beneficial to humans. And so a potter is envious of another, and a craftsman of another, a beggar is jealous of the next, and a minstrel of minstrel.
Eris was adopted from Greek mythology into Roman mythology as Discordia.

The name of her moon, Dysnomia, refers in Greek mythology to the demon of lawlessness and daughter of Eris.[10]

Interpretation
As a newly discovered celestial body, there are no binding and generally accepted interpretations of it yet.

Rolf Liefeld assumes that while Eris can represent strife and discord, a fundamental drive of hers is ambition. And this can manifest both harmfully and helpfully, as it also encompasses determination, a will to win, and healthy competitiveness.[11]

3 Juno is a minor planet or asteroid that orbits around the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is the 11th-largest asteroid but was the third asteroid to be discovered. It is one of the two largest stony (S-type) asteroids, and is estimated to contain 1% of the total mass of the asteroid belt. Amongst S-type asteroids, Juno is unusually reflective. This high albedo explains its relatively high apparent magnitude for a small object not near the inner edge of the asteroid belt. Juno can reach +7.5 at a favourable opposition, which is brighter than Neptune.
It was discovered on 1 September 1804 at 22h12 LMT[4] by German astronomer Karl L. Harding in Lilienthal[5], close to Bremen in Germany.
Its mean distance to the Sun is 399.4 million km - which is slightly closer to the Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, greater than that of Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the Sun at perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres.
It takes 4.36 years for one sidereal orbit.
Juno's small size and irregular shape preclude it from being designated a Dwarf Planet.

Karma
Jump to navigationJump to search

Indian Astrology[1]
The word Karma comes from Sanskrit and means action, also effective action. It refers to the philosophical teaching of cause and effect which applies not only to events on Earth.

Contrary to widely held belief, Karma does not imply a kind of moral or ethical judgement; it has nothing to do with guilt or being rewarded or punished but in its purest form is the idea that every action has consequences which humans cannot evade.

Karma makes little sense without the idea of reincarnation because the chain of cause and effect does not end with physical death. The effects of actions which remain at the time of death - whether good or bad - are carried over into the next life.

In Buddhist view life's aim is not to collect as much "good" Karma as possible by good behaviour but to free oneself from all Karma. For this is the only way to escape the otherwise endless cycle of rebirths.

The teaching of Karma demands more radically than almost any other spiritual teaching that individuals take on full responsibility for their own fate. Fate thus understood does not refer to our experience of external events, heredity, upbringing or socialisation. Everything we experience is the effect or result of our own previous actions. Therein lies a great freedom which is generally misunderstood in the West where the idea of Karma is usually understood as justifying fatalism. In reality Karma means exactly the opposite. It implies that our freedom to act is also the freedom to actively participate in creating our own fate.

For esoteric astrology and karmic astrology the natal chart reveals the kinds of karmic constellations that are already present at birth, and therefore what kind of causes are waiting to be realised as effect. Karmic Astrology
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Uroboros[1]
A branch of astrology based on the concept of reincanations-cycles. Karma is seen as the universal law of cause and effect, in which it is supposed to exist some kind of morality. Karmic Astrology believes that the horoscope can help us recognise the effects of past actions in the present life and how our present karma may affect future lives. Karmic astrology is closely related to religion and spiritual teachings. Indeed, it necessarily implies the belief in reincarnation, as the soul (everyone's immortal part) is thought to evolve from life to life - in order to perfect itself. Thus, karmic astrology is an astrology of the soul. It is the branch of astrology in which subjective experience plays the greatest role.

Interpretation
There are few generally valid guidelines for astrological interpretations regarding karma:

Houses
There is a special mportance of the fourth, eighth and twelfth houses which are associated with the water element
The Eighth House is thought to reveal past Karma
The Fourth House shows present Karma. The Imum Coeli - the cusp of the fourth house - is thought to reveal the nature of the tasks an individual will have to face in this life
The twelfth House signifies future Karma
Planets, Rulers, Signs and Nodes
The planet Pluto, the ruler of the eighth house together with the sign of Scorpio are thought to reveal the nature of past Karma
Great significance is attributed to the Moon and Saturn, the latter often being referred to as the "lord of karma"
The Moon's Nodes play an important role, too: The Moon's South Node represents our karmic ancestry and we are probably familiar with the themes indicated by it. On the other hand, he Moon's North Node shows our karmic aim in life, something which is likely to cause feelings of anxiety because there we cannot rely on past experiences to help us

The moon's nodes are not physical planetary bodies but the points of intersection between the sun's apparent orbital path around the earth, the ecliptic, and the moon's orbital path around the earth.

Astronomy
There are two points of intersection which are situated directly opposite each other, forming the nodal axis. These points of intersection occur because the plane of the moon's orbital path is inclined to the sun's (in reality the earth's)orbit at an angle of 5 degrees and 9 minutes. The moon can be located either north or south of the plane of the ecliptic.

The point at which the moon crosses the plane of the ecliptic when moving in a northerly direction is called ascending moon's node or north node. Two weeks later the moon intersects the ecliptic plane going in a southerly direction and this point of intersection is called the moon's south node.

The series of moon's nodes move in a clockwise (i.e. retrograde) direction around the zodiac and take 18 years, 7 months and 9 days to make one complete revolution. Eclipses occur when either the new or full moon occurs close to the nodal axis.

Ephemerides often give two different values for the moon's node: for the so-called mean moon's node and the true moon's node. The former is an average value and is always retrograde. The true moon's node, on the other hand, continually changes direction, although it also usually moves in retrograde motion through the zodiac. The true moon's node, contrary to its name, is not always an accurate value because the moon does not follow an exact ecliptic path around the earth.

Some astrologers prefer to work with the true moon's nodes, while others use the mean value. In any case, the two are never separated by more than 1.5 degrees of arc.

In some horoscopes only the ascending node is shown, although the descending node is always situated opposite.


The Nodal Axis
Mythology
Astrologers of the past envisioned the earth as surrounded by a cosmic dragon who swallowed the sun or the moon during an eclipse. This idea gave rise to the terms Dragon's Head (Caput Draconis, or ascending moon's node) and Dragon's Tail (Cauda Draconis, or descending moon's node). This imagery also appears in Indian Astrology with Rahu, the dragon's head; and Ketu, the dragon's tail. The Hindu god Vishnu is credited with beheading a serpent demon, called Rahu. Both parts of the serpent are immortal, however, and capable of concealing the light of the sun and moon.

In Indian astrology, the nodes are considered shadow planets, constituting two of the nine Navagrahas, or heavenly bodies that influence life on earth. The mythology of the nodes arises from a mythic tale contained in ancient Sanskrit texts, where the nodes are portrayed as the severed head and tail of a great dragon. Medieval western astrologers also utilized this dragon imagery, and referred to the nodes as the head and tail of the dragon — one which increases good or bad, another which drains and empties out good or bad.

Interpretation
The moon's nodes, as the points at which the paths of the sun and the moon cross, represent a symbolic merger of the sun and the moon, or the meeting of two (masculine and feminine) poles.

The descending or south node is associated with the past, whether in the karmic sense of things brought over from past lives into the present one, or in the sense of the influence of the past in the present life, such as one's inherited traits and childhood. The south node may also show an area of life where the person is proficient, but yet where little further growth will occur: the person's "comfort zone." It is not necessary to believe in karma and reincarnation to work with the moon's nodes.

The ascending or north node stands for the future or direction in which the person should develop. This direction may be similar to the rest of the chart, or it may suggest new and unfamiliar territory. The challenge is not to leave behind the south node but to achieve a balance between the two, whereby the experience gained at the south node can be used to further the development of themes represented by the north node.

The ascending node is sometimes associated with Jupiter and the descending node with Saturn. Saturn may be related to the south node in the sense that it is often associated with the past, difficult topics (Shadow), and compulsive patterns of behaviour, whereas the ascending node is associated with opportunities to grow, after facing up to the themes associated with the south node. Another planetary comparison is that the north node equates to the solar principle and the south node to the lunar one.

The moon's nodal axis symbolizes an overriding central theme in the horoscope. For an individual person the house positions of the two nodes indicate important areas of life or domains of activity, whereas the signs indicate their styles or modes of activity.

The descending node reflects childhood experiences, particularly those present from an early age. Because they are so taken for granted, the individual may be tempted to fall back into familiar and at times obsessive behaviour patterns when confronted with new challenges. This behaviour may also lead to negative experiences which can leave the child - or later adult - with feelings of inadequacy. When this happens the behaviour pattern can have addictive traits while offering only apparent but not real security.

At the same time the themes symbolised by the north node may appear to be a shining ideal which, however, requires great effort to achieve. With increasing age the individual usually becomes more aware of the calling to reach this goal, particularly between the ages of 18 1/2 and 37 when the transiting moon's nodes return to their positions in the natal chart. An individual remains largely unconscious of the themes associated with the south node while (ideally) striving to achieve the themes associated with the north node. However, this goal can only be reached if a balance is achieved between the two poles.

Planets which are conjunct the descending node or in square aspect to the nodal axis are generally difficult to cope with and are often experienced as deficits. The challenge is to find new and creative ways to express them. The Swiss astrologer Claude Weiss stated that: "The person who is able to let go of the past is the one most able to find constructive ways of expressing planets conjunct the descending moon's node, and with this he transcends the apparent contradiction between the descending and ascending moon's nodes. He/She then experiences planets conjunct the descending node as if they were conjunct the north one because he/she has managed to free him/herself from a linear understanding of time."

Planets which are conjunct the ascending moon's node or in harmonious aspect to the nodal axis can help an individual to rise to the challenge represented by the south node and costructively explore those new aspects of life symbolised by it. Moon

The moon is the earth's only natural satellite. It has an equatorial diameter of 3.476 km and its average distance from the earth is 384.400 km. Only one (and the same) side of the moon is visible from earth.

The moon requires 27 days, 7 hours and 43 minutes for one orbital period, which is the time it takes to pass through the same point on the hourly circle of a fixed star (a sidereal month). This is a shorter period than the one between two identical phases of the moon - for example from new Moon to new moon - which is 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes (a synodic month). The moon's average Diurnal Movement is 13 and 10 minutes.

Viewed from the earth and measured in degrees and minutes of arc, the moon has an average diameter of 31 minutes - because the moon's distance from the earth varies slightly this figure can be somewhat larger or smaller. This is also the same size as the sun which has (again as viewed from the earth) a diameter of 32 minutes of arc. The sun and moon appear to be the same size in the view from earth, something that astrology considers to be highly significant. Knowing that the sun and the moon have a diameter of around half a degree can be useful when trying to judge distances when making astrological observations.

The moon is never retrograde.

The four main lunar phases are: new moon (a sun-moon-conjunction), waxing moon (around the first quarter or separating square), full moon (a sun-moon-opposition) and the waning moon (the last quarter or applying square).


3 moon's phases[2]
Mythology
Liz Greene[3]: The magic of the ever changing Moon fascinates us now as much as it did those past civilizations who saw a great and mysterious deity in its fluctuating faces and its link with the cycles of organic life.

In myth the Moon is usually portrayed as female, although certain ancient peoples such as the Babylonians saw in its luminous face a young and beautiful male spirit who symbolized the ebb and flow of nature. The lunar deities presided over the cycles of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, governed menstruation and childbirth, and embodied the instinctual forces at the heart of life.

In Egypt the Moon was represented as Isis, goddess of merey and wisdom, and the archetypal image of woman in both maternal and erotic guise. The compassion of Isis was understood to be a power as great as the might of the war-gods or the procreative force of the Sun, and those in need of help appealed to her as the mother of all life.

In Greece, the Moon was worshiped as the wild huntress Artemis, mistress of beasts, untameable and eternally virgin, whose great temple at Ephesus was one of the wonders of the ancient world. She roamed the forests accompanied by her younger female companions.

Any men who showed her disrespect were severely punished and often killed. Artemis nevertheless was one of the patrons of motherhood and childbirth, which probably relates to the analogy of the waxing and full moon resembling pregnancy.In Rome, she was known as Diana, twin sister of the sun god Apollo and protectress of children and animals.

Her more sinister face, called Hecate and symbolized by the dark of the Moon, reflected her powers of sorcery and her rulership over the underworld of souls waiting to be reborn. These goddesses were worshiped primarily by women. They personified the female mysteries of conception and birth, and the deeper workings of Fate through the weaving of the tissues of the body in the underworld of the womb.

The Moon is related to the goddess and feminine principle in most cultures, although it is masculine in a few, such as in the pre-Christian Norse pantheon and in ancient Egypt, where Thoth was a moon god before the Hellenists assimilated him to Mercury. The diversity of moon goddesses in cultures conquered by the Greeks and Romans is attested to by the large number of moon deities in their mythology.

The oldest Greek goddess is Selene (Semele), whose two daughters were fathered by Zeus. Selene was eventually joined, if not entirely supplanted by Artemis.

The Greeks also assigned different goddesses to the different lunar phases. As the independent virgin hunter, Artemis usually symbolised the waxing Moon. The matronly, fertile aspect of the full Moon is symbolised by Hera (Latin Juno), wife of Zeus and protector of home and family.

Hekate (Hecate) was goddess of the waning moon and the crone phase in a woman's life. She is an example of a once powerful and revered goddess who was "deposed" by later more male-oriented beliefs. Hekate's prototype, the Egyptian goddess Hekit, presided over childbirth, notably the birth of the infant sun-god each morning. While earlier myths describe Hekate as a supremely powerful and helpful nature goddess, she later became a byword for an evil, fearsome witch.

From the time of the poet Hesiod (8th century bc) on, the Fates were personified as three very old women who spin the threads of human destiny. Their names were Clotho (Spinner), Lachesis (Allotter), and Atropos (Inflexible).

Rulerships
The Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus; it is in detriment in Capricorn and in fall in Scorpio.

The moon rules the stomach and the female breast as symbol for femininity and inborn capability to nourish, together with the womb as an organ of procreation. The moon traditionally rules several bodily fluids, such as lymphatic liquids, breast milk, seminal fluid and the mucous membrane. The Moon is also linked to the the capacity of the nervous system to unconsciously control basic physical processes.

The moon traditionally rules phenomena that modern astrologers give to Neptune, such as the sea and alcohol. It is a primary indicator of one's mother, home, emotional needs, and feelings. It is also associated with mature women, vs. Venus as a symbol of young women.

Interpretation
In astrological interpretation the moon, together with the sun and the ascendant, is one of the three most important features in the horoscope. It symbolizes one's sub-conscious, emotional make-up and needs. Because the moon is not the rational, verbal part of the chart, but rather operates at a "feeling" level, it is difficult to explain it in words.


Romeo and Juliet[5]
Consequently mood-swings are associated with the moon. Ancient observers, however, understood that these changes were orderly and predictable, and therefore could be used in time-keeping. "Moon" and "month" have the same root.

Others stressed the moon's reflectance of the sun's light. Perhaps this seemed like an appropriately female interpretation of the moon in view of the sun interpreted as "the king", yet all of the planets visible to the naked eye or photographic images also reflect light, including the "masculine" planets Mars and Jupiter. Nevertheless as the celestial body that most clearly reflects the sun's light and that most obviously changes form during its cycle, the astrological moon symbolises the receptive principle whose creative act is to receive something and transform it into something new, in the same way that the moon receives the light of the sun and bathes the earth in its silvery mysterious light.

The moon's house and sign show the individual's instinctive emotional reaction without having first been filtered by consciousness. It also stands for the instincts and an individual's need for emotional security.

Children will therefore express their lunar qualities in a more direct manner than adults. The lunar principle is the most important one during an individual's early childhood, and it is only from about the seventh year (or puberty) that the solar principle begins to become more powerful.(See Astrology of Children).

In later life the position of the moon in the horoscope indicates the kind of experiences a person is likely to have had during childhood. It also continues to accompany each individual throughout life as their "inner child".

Karmic astrology considers the moon to be a "vessel for the karmic memories of the soul." There is a long historical tradition of considering the moon as the home of the dead, and the idea of the moon as a "dead" planet continues with some forms of esoteric astrology. The moon symbolises the nocturnal "consciousness" as manifested in dreams, but also in the phase shortly before falling asleep.

The moon symbolizes the feminine principle, particularly its maternal nurturing side, and in an individual's horoscope, the symbol of the person's image of the actual mother. The moon's orbital period may be related to a woman's menstrual cycle, and in a woman's horoscope is, together with Venus, part of her feminine identity. If a woman has children, her moon will indicate her likely attitude to motherhood and her relationship with her children, so that the themes of nurturing and caring are important when interpreting the position of the moon. On a concrete level it also symbolises the actual home environment.

The position of the moon also says something about an individual's physical health due to the effect the emotions have upon the physical body (psychosomatics).

In the horoscope of a nation or politician the moon stands for the populace. In an event chart, however, the moon may act as a trigger, even when planets seemingly more involved in the event are not exact. In a horary chart, the moon symbolizes the querent and its applying aspects are critical to the judgment.

When the moon aspects other planets or a main axis in the natal horoscope, some of their qualities will be reflected in the moon's emotional nature, and vice versa. For example, moon-Mars contacts may indicate "angry feelings." The effects of the moon in transit on a natal chart are usually only felt for a few hours and indicate passing changes in moods. Hard transits of outer planets to the moon can be emotionally trying: for example a moon-Saturn contact may lead to feelings of discouragement. The progressed moon moves relatively quickly and can indicate changing areas of focus in the maturing person's life.Nakshatra

Nakshatras and the zodiac
Nakshatra (Sanskrit: नक्षत्र) are a division of the sidereal Ecliptic into 27 lunar star groups in traditional Indian astrology. A simple translation of the term is: star, lunar mansion, planetary configuration assigned to one of the lunar mansions. Each Nakshatra is exactly 13°20' in extent. They roughly correspond to the days of the sidereal month, i.e., the Moon rises each day in a different Nakshatra. The twelve months of the Hindu lunisolar calendar are named after twelve of the lunar stations.

Mythology
In Hindu myth the 27 Nakshatras are the daughters of Daksha and all were given in marriage to the Moon god Chandra.[2] He favored Rohini above the others, whereupon the jealous sisters complained to their father. When Soma/Chandra ignored Daksha’s protest, Daksha cursed the Moon to waste away. The daughters then felt pity and begged for mercy. Daksha could not revoke the curse, only mitigate it, so the Moon now wanes for fourteen days and then waxes for fourteen days.

Astrology
The system of the Nakshatras is already fully attested in the Yajurveda (ca. 1000 BCE) and spread widely across Asia; whether the system was first developed by Indians or by the Chinese is debated. It is clear, however, that the Arabs—already in pre-Islamic times—adopted and reshaped the system of lunar mansions (Manāzil al-Qamar). While large parts of Indian astrology derive from western sources that reached India in the Hellenistic period, the Nakshatras belong to an older stratum of astrology native to Asia.

The Moon’s position in the Nakshatras plays a key role in Indian astrology (Jyotish). Unlike western astrology, which privileges the Sun, Jyotish gives primacy to the Moon (Chandra). Its position in the natal chart indicates the true birth star and the meanings associated with it.

ChatGPT said:
Wow, that’s a dense and rich compilation of karma, lunar, and Nakshatra info—basically a full crash course in karmic astrology and Jyotish lunar lore. Let me summarize and highlight the key threads so it all clicks together:

1. Karma and Karmic Astrology
Core idea: Karma is pure cause and effect, not moral reward/punishment. Every action has consequences, often spanning multiple lifetimes (hence reincarnation is integral).

Buddhist angle: Life isn’t about collecting “good karma,” it’s about freeing oneself from all karma to escape the cycle of rebirth.

Astrological lens: Your natal chart maps karmic tendencies:

4th House: Present-life karma; tasks to complete now.

8th House: Past-life karma; what you carry forward.

12th House: Future karma; what you’re preparing for.

Key planetary and nodal indicators:

Saturn: “Lord of karma,” structure, responsibility, life lessons.

Pluto/Scorpio/Eighth House: Past-life residues and deep transformation.

Moon: Emotional memory, comfort zones, subconscious reactions.

Moon’s Nodes: South node = past/familiar; North node = karmic aim/challenge.

2. Moon & Lunar Influence
Astronomical basics: Orbits Earth in ~27 days; visible phases influence cycles.

Symbolism & mythology: Female principle, motherhood, cycles of growth, instincts.

Waxing Moon → Artemis, virgin huntress, expansion, new beginnings.

Full Moon → Hera/Juno, maturity, fulfillment, realization.

Waning Moon → Hekate, introspection, endings, the crone archetype.

Astrological meaning: The Moon rules emotions, instincts, subconscious, and nurturance. It’s the chart’s emotional barometer.

3. Moon’s Nodes (Rahu & Ketu)
South Node / Ketu: Past karma, innate skills, comfort zones, inherited patterns. Can feel safe but stagnant.

North Node / Rahu: Life purpose, karmic challenges, unknown territory. Often anxiety-inducing but essential for growth.

Balance: Goal is integration—use lessons from the South Node to evolve toward North Node potential.

4. Nakshatras (27 Lunar Mansions)
Key feature: Moon moves through ~13°20’ of each Nakshatra daily; each represents karmic and emotional “flavor” for that day of birth.

Themes:

Ashvini: Beginnings, life energy.

Bharani: Law, morality, responsibility.

Rohini: Creativity, enterprise, sensuality.

Pushya: Growth, blessings, nourishment.

Mūla: Roots, digging, transformation, uncovering hidden truths.

Revatī: Completion, fulfillment, charisma, magical charm.

Each Nakshatra also has specific cautions or challenges, like impatience, restlessness, or overwork.

5. How It All Connects
Your Moon placement = emotional karmic lens.

Nodes = karmic trajectory (where you came from vs. where you’re going).

Nakshatras = subtle emotional and karmic coloring of the Moon, showing how you navigate daily life and evolve spiritually.

Planets/Signs/Houses = specific arenas of karmic effect, challenges, and growth opportunities.

If you want, I can make a practical “karmic map” cheat sheet that condenses all this into a visual flow: South Node → Moon → North Node → Nakshatra → Planet → House, so you can actually see your karmic “action plan” at a glance.

Do you want me to do that?

Descending Moon's Node
Jump to navigationJump to search

The dragon's head and its tail (= South Node)[1]

Smbol
Synonym: Moon's South Node

The point at which the path of the Moon intersects the Sun's path (the ecliptic) when moving in a Southerly direction as seen from the Earth.

The Ascending Moon's Node is situated directly opposite.

In Indian Astrology the South Node is a god named Ketu and has planetary status.

Interpretation
The descending or south node is associated with the past, whether in the karmic sense of things brought over from past lives into the present one, or in the sense of the influence of the past in the present life, such as one's inherited traits. The south node may also show an area of life where the person is proficient, but yet where little further growth will occur: the person's "comfort zone."

The descending node reflects childhood experiences, particularly those present from an early age. Because they are so taken for granted, the individual may be tempted to fall back into familiar and at times obsessive behaviour patterns when confronted with new challenges. This behaviour may also lead to negative experiences which can leave the child - or later adult - with feelings of inadequacy. When this happens the behaviour pattern can have addictive traits while offering only apparent but not real security.

An individual remains largely unconscious of the themes associated with the south node while (ideally) striving to achieve the themes associated with the north node. However, this goal can only be reached if a balance is achieved between the two poles.


At the moon's nodes the moon's orbit intercepts the ecliptic
The descending node is sometimes associated with Saturn. Saturn may be related to the south node in the sense that it is often associated with the past, difficult topics (Shadow), and compulsive patterns of behaviour. Another planetary comparison is that the south node equates to the lunar principle (the moon).

Planets which are conjunct the descending node or in square aspect to the nodal axis are generally difficult to cope with and are often experienced as deficits. The challenge is to find new and creative ways to express them. The Swiss astrologer Claude Weiss stated that: "The person who is able to let go of the past is the one most able to find constructive ways of expressing planets conjunct the descending moon's node, and with this he transcends the apparent contradiction between the descending and ascending moon's nodes. He/She then experiences planets conjunct the descending node as if they were conjunct the north one because he/she has managed to free him/herself from a linear understanding of time."

The crescent three days after New Moon
Astronomy
The New Moon is the lunar phase in which the Moon cannot be seen from the Earth, or appears as a slender crescent in the West after sunset.

A solar eclipse occurs when the New Moon occurs close to the Moon's nodal axis.

Interpretation
In astrological terminology it represents a Conjunction between the Sun and the Moon, and the stage at which they have just begun to separate. The energies of both - spiritual consciousness and emotional nature - join forces. The sign in which the conjunction falls usually determines which is likely to be dominant. If it falls in a Water Sign or Earth Sign, the lunar energy tends to dominate, whereas in a Fire Sign or Air Sign, the situation is reversed. In addition to the sign it is also important to take Aspects to other horoscope factors into consideration because they will also have an affect.

In a general sense, the New Moon is a symbol of new beginnings, and in esoteric and karmic astrology this is seen as symbolising the beginning of existence itself. According to this tradition, the Moon is finally reborn after dying and going to the solar paradise. Many historical cultures have attributed great significance to the appearance of the crescent New Moon. Lunar Node Horoscope

The Lunar Node Axis
The Lunar Node Horoscope is a specialty of the Huber School.

Technique
Starting from the ascending Lunar Node of the natal chart, which becomes the Ascendant (the descending Lunar Node becomes the Descendant), the Lunar Node Horoscope is usually represented by mirroring all planets across the Lunar Node Axis. The zodiac effectively runs backwards[1][2], and the usual house order is maintained in this way. However, equal (30-degree) houses are used here.[3]

In fact, this is a lunar orbit house system. The aspects of the planets to each other remain the same; only the emphasis of the aspects to the Lunar Node or Ascendant changes slightly (due to the orbs) (the one to the ascending Lunar Node of the Lunar Node Horoscope).

So far, only a few astrology programs can calculate and draw a Lunar Node Horoscope.

Interpretation
The contents of the Lunar Node Horoscope are seen as quite unconscious from the Huber perspective. They represent the Shadow personality, or a sum of past lives (not just the previous one); in it, the themes of karmic history are recognizable, as well as family historical influences. It clarifies why we react with reflexive patterns in certain situations; where we come from/our origin, the longings, desires, and expectations we hold towards life. The Lunar Node Age Point (retrograde) reveals hidden growth lines, which can lead to intense developmental spurts when it intersects with the Age Point of the natal chart.

Since only the house positions of the planets change in relation to the natal chart, essentially only these are interpreted. For example, with an emphasis on the twelfth house, Louise Huber assumes a monastic existence in a past life.

Birgit Braun: "The Lunar Node Horoscope can also contain positive elements. It holds possibilities and potentials, but also conflicts and traumatic experiences." As a "Mirror Horoscope", the LNH symbolizes the so-called mirror sphere or astral world, an inversion of the usual, normal world. The astral body is a concept frequently used in Theosophy and Anthroposophy, originally going back to Paracelsus and his "sideral body". It is primarily active in our dream life. In it, time and space are reversed: the dimensions of time lie here almost side by side, and the spatial backdrops or scenes are characterized by a sequence.


The Ba of the human in winged form corresponds to the astral body.[4]
Three Horoscopes
Advanced Huber practitioners work with three horoscopes. Roughly speaking, the basic horoscope illustrates the present, the Lunar Node Horoscope illustrates the past, and the House Horoscope illustrates the potential of the natal chart (the future).

Evaluation
The method is based on the assumption of reincarnation; and this is notoriously difficult to prove.[5] However, the concept of the Lunar Node Houses does have a certain coherence and consistency, especially in their retrogression; its evidence cannot be dismissed. Since there are no objective criteria for a definitive evaluation, it ultimately depends on subjective conviction whether one can make use of the Lunar Node Horoscope.[6] Draconitic zodiac

6	Sources and Notes
Method/Procedure
The Draconic Zodiac of a person or an event is calculated by setting the (existing) Tropical North Node individually as the point 0° Aries. The other Horoscope Factors are shifted in the horoscope circle by the corresponding difference amount (the ecliptic length of the lunar node).
Like the Tropical or the Sidereal Zodiac, the Draconic Zodiac is also divided into twelve Signs, each of thirty degrees.
These also carry the same (known) names.

The Draconic or Draconic Horoscope is largely identical to the birth or radix horoscope; the horoscope image is the same - only with shifted zodiac positions, i.e., using the Draconic Zodiac (instead of the Tropical or a Sidereal one). All planets thus retain their position in the Houses, and form the same Aspects with each other as in the Radix.

Interpretation
The Draconic Horoscope or the respective Draconic Zodiac likely provides indications on the theme of reincarnation or past lives, similar to the Lunar Node.
The horoscope comparison with the conventional (Tropical) radix can also be enlightening, as well as the Synastry with other people or event horoscopes.
However, the claim that the Draconic Horoscope indicates the "soul" of a person, their "true" or "higher self"[1], must be relegated to the realm of esoteric speculation. Solar Eclipse

Eclipse 1999[1]
The complete or partial darkening of the sun caused when a conjunction between the sun and the moon occurs close to the moon's nodal axis (Moon's Nodes). The actual technical term is new moon eclipse. A solar eclipse can be a powerful trigger.Sidereal Month

The September full moon, called a "harvest moon"
Astronomy
The Full Moon is a Lunar Phase in which the Moon is fully illuminated by the light of the Sun and visible from Earth as a round disc.

When the Full Moon occurs close enough to the Moon's nodal axis, it can result in a lunar eclipse.

Interpretation
In astrological terms, it occurs when the Sun and the Moon are in opposition. The energies of both planets - spiritual consciousness and emotional needs - oppose and challenge each other.

If, at the time of the opposition, the Sun and the Moon are in water and earth signs the Moon's energy will tend to be stronger, whereas if they are in fire and air signs the energy of the Sun will tend to dominate. The interpretation of the opposition will be further affected by any additional aspects from other planets to it.

In addition to the astrological interpretation, the Full Moon is also a symbol for the climax of an enterprise or cycle which now becomes public. After this point has been reached a process of withdrawal and dying off begins. Although the Full Moon generally plays a greater role than the New Moon in the minds of most people and is sometimes marked with celebrations, most spiritual teachings consider it to be less significant. Hecate

Triple-faced Hekate[1]

2. The Asteroid in the Asteroid Belt with the asteroid number 100. Although interpretative approaches are being examined, work with this celestial body has not yet gained traction, let alone established uniform interpretative standards.
The celestial body has an average diameter of 89 km and an orbital period around the Sun of 5 1/2 years. Its orbit is located at the outer edge of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 11 July 1868 by James Craig Watson in Michigan.[2]


Roman coin of Hekate
Myth and Ritual
Hekate is one of the oldest pre-patriarchal Earth and Sun goddesses. In archaic times, the dark and hidden side of the goddess was associated with the Sun, which travels underground from west to east at night; thus, she is also equated with the New Moon in astrology.

In Greek mythology, she is the goddess of magic, necromancy, and hauntings, representing the aspect of thresholds and transitions (birth, crossroads, particularly of three paths), and is considered the guardian of the gates between worlds.

On the last day of the month (which fell on the New Moon in the Athenian calendar), banishing rituals were performed, and offerings were made to Hekate and the deceased at the crossroads. Sacred meals were held in her honor at the Full Moon.

In Late Antiquity, she was especially revered by the Neoplatonists - as a universal goddess who united various goddesses within herself. She was seen as the World Soul (anima mundi), from which all souls spring and to which they return. Additionally, she was a mediator between the world of humans and that of the higher gods. At the end of ancient Greece, her cult became a - secret, esoteric - mystery cult.[3] Lilith

Astronomy
Lilith has at least three separate astrological meanings. The main one defines Lilith as a sensitive point on the moon's orbit, called Black Moon Lilith. Astrologers disagree regarding the best astronomical calculation of Lilith. Most astrologers follow one of the two following definitions.

The first method defines Lilith as the second focal point of the Moon's elliptical orbit next to the first one, the Earth.
The second method defines Lilith as the Moon's apogee, i.e. that point on the Moon's elliptical orbit which is furthest away from the Earth.
To a certain extent both are correct, although the second focal point and apogee are not identical. Strictly speaking, the Moon's orbit is not truly elliptical, making it difficult to accurately define the position of the focal points. This fact would seem to support the use of the apogee to define Lilith's position. However, the question as to which point should be chosen for Lilith is in actual fact irrelevant because the focal point and apogee lie on the same line (as viewed from the Earth) and are therefore both situated at the same degree of the zodiac.

Lilith forms an axis with Priapus, which is situated about 180 degrees opposite to Lilith.

There are considerable problems in calculating these apsides: "Although Kepler ellipses are a good means to describe planetary orbits, they fail with the orbit of the moon, which is strongly perturbed by the gravitational pull of the sun. This solar perturbation results in gigantic monthly oscillations in the ephemeris of the osculating apsides (the amplitude is 30 degrees). It turns out that the motions of the lunar perigee and apogee form curves of different quality and the two points are usually not in opposition to each other. They are more or less opposite points only at times when the sun is in conjunction with one of them or at an angle of 90° from them" (Dieter Koch).

Ephemerides often give a "true" and "mean" position for Lilith which can vary considerably from each other. However, the so-called true position of Lilith does often not equate with the astronomical reality and is therefore something of a misnomer. So most astrologers who work with Lilith use the "mean" position.

It takes Lilith about 8 years and 10 months to make one revolution through the zodiac.

In addition, two further phenomena are or were known under the name of Lilith:

From Antiquity until modern times some astronomers and esotericists thought the "black moon" was a second terrestrial satellite located in front of the Moon and therefore invisible from Earth. According to astronomical laws and decades of modern astronomical discoveries, no such satellites exist. A Dr. Waldemath postulated such a satellite in 1898, with a distance from the earth of 2.67 times the distance of the moon,a daily motion of about 3 degrees, and a 700-km diameter. Known as "Waldemath's Black Moon", it would have been detected by satellite telescopes if it actually existed.
Asteroid #1181 is called Lilith, located between Mars and Jupiter.

Mythology
Creation: Lilith is mentioned for the first time in ancient Jewish texts, including Genesis and the Talmud. However, her myth was also influenced by earlier Mesopotamian legends, where she was considered a demon or malevolent spirit.[3] Harmful female spirits supposedly seduced unsuspecting men in their sleep, harmed women in childbirth, and stole babies from their cradles. Jewish folklore adopted some of these Babylonian myths of the she-devil, identifying Lilith as the "first Eve" and wife of Adam. Rather than being formed from Adam's rib, she was an equal partner, and from the very beginning there was great competition between the two of them. When making love, they both insisted on lying on top, and because neither was willing to compromise, Lilith abandoned paradise. She broke another taboo by daring to speak the unmentionable name of God. God then sent three angels demanding her return, but she refused, continuing her evil career as the mother of hundreds of demons.

Lilith persisted in Jewish lore through the Middle Ages, in the demonology of the Kabbalah and in the folk practices of the people, who used protective amulets to ward off Lilith's evil-doing. Her stories spread to Christianity, and she appears in works of Dante, Hugo, and Goethe.

Hardly any other mythological figure has been demonised by patriarchal culture to the same extent as Lilith. In response, some spiritual branches of feminism have idealised Lilith as a figure of female emancipation and a rebel against patriarchal suppression.

Interpretation
Lilith, also known as the Black Moon, is not only difficult to define astronomically but also difficult to interpret. From an astrological point of view Lilith is associated with the more hidden, mysterious aspects of the feminine archetype, with independence, rebelliousness, pride and strength. The long tradition in Western culture of suppressing the feminine has made Lilith appear to have threatening aspects. However, this is only true if she is banished into the unconsciousness. Finally, the integration and development of the energy symbolised by Lilith - in both men and women - is part of a process leading to a more inclusive and integrative life. The unfathomable suffering associated with Lilith themes is often a prerequisite for development of artistic potential.

Hannelore Traugott, a recognised German Lilith expert, writes, "Lilith represents something that has become unconscious and is striving to become conscious again. Let's call it archaic energy, spiritual femininity, something akin to the wisdom of the goddess. As long as we don't have access to this energy we experience it psychologically as loss, suppression, isolation, emptiness, addiction and above all power struggles."

Kocku von Stuckrad notes, "For me, Lilith embodies the presence of an archaic form of feminine strength that ignores any patriarchal discourse of power and dominance and allies itself with those forces that affirm life itself." This interpretation is probably closest to the common one in English-language astrology, in which Lilith has become an emblem of women's empowerment. Since Lilith's energies are still not socially acceptable in many contexts, however, Black Moon Lilith, like her mythological namesake, may appear angry and confrontational, or else suppressed and exiled where it appears in a horoscope. From these raw emotional states, however, may come lunar regeneration.[4]

Because Lilith is a sensitive point rather than an actual heavenly body, it is not a planetary ruler. Some practitioners of the Kabbalah, however, associate it with Saturn, probably in the sense of Saturn as a Malefic. Waxing and Waning
Jump to navigationJump to search

Waxing or waning?
The waxing moon increases in light, from New Moon to Full Moon phase, or in its first and second quarters. The waning moon decreases from full moon to the dark of the moon in its third and fourth quarter phases.

In electional astrology the waxing moon is auspicious for expansion and growth of an enterprise. The waning moon, however, is useful for events to be diminished or drawn to a conclusion. This principle applies in minute detail in farming by moon signs, whereby the waxing moon is good for planting above-ground crops but the waning moon is good for killing weeds or butchering livestock. It is also good for planting root crops.

More generally any planet or astrological event is waxing if it increases in influence, and waning if it decreases in influence.
ChatGPT said:
Ah, you’ve basically dumped a full encyclopedia of lunar and nodal astrology here—but don’t worry, I can break it down into the core essence for you. Let’s organize it so it actually makes sense for practical or spiritual interpretation.

1. Moon’s Nodes (Ascending / Descending)
Ascending Node (Dragon’s Head / Rahu in Vedic astrology): Where your soul is moving toward—growth, destiny, and new challenges.

Descending Node (Dragon’s Tail / Ketu): Where your soul is coming from—past life karma, childhood patterns, inherited traits, and comfort zones.

Key points about the Descending Node:

Shows your strengths, but these strengths can also trap you in repetitive or compulsive behaviors.

Childhood experiences and early conditioning are highlighted here.

Associated with Saturnian lessons: shadow work, limitation, and karma.

Planets conjunct or square the South Node often feel heavy or difficult—they’re like “old energy” you carry that needs conscious reworking.

Goal: balance the South Node with the North Node rather than rejecting it.

2. Lunar Node Horoscope (Huber School)
Uses the nodes as axis points to mirror the natal chart.

Focuses on the shadow self, past lives, family patterns, karmic tendencies.

Can indicate reflexive reactions, hidden desires, or deep soul drives.

Retrograde nodal points show areas for intense growth when intersecting your natal Age Point.

Three horoscopes approach (Huber):

Natal chart → present life focus

Lunar Node Horoscope → past/karmic influences

House Horoscope → potential/future path

3. Draconic Zodiac
A zodiac shifted so the North Node = 0° Aries.

Same planetary positions in houses and aspects, but the zodiac degrees shift.

Often used to study soul purpose, past lives, or the higher self.

Best for comparing to the tropical chart (synastry, life themes).

4. Eclipses, New & Full Moon
New Moon near nodes → solar eclipse → powerful triggers for new beginnings, sometimes karmic resets.

Full Moon near nodes → lunar eclipse → culmination, public revelation, or emotional release.

Astrologically:

Water/Earth signs → lunar energy dominates

Fire/Air signs → solar energy dominates

5. Lilith / Black Moon
Not a planet—more a sensitive point on the Moon’s orbit, often the apogee.

Themes: hidden feminine power, rebellion, independence, pride.

Can show suppressed, shadowed, or rejected energy in the psyche.

Working consciously with Lilith energy → artistic potential, personal empowerment, lunar regeneration.

6. Waxing vs. Waning Moon
Waxing → growth, expansion, manifestation

Waning → release, closure, reduction

In astrology, this principle applies metaphorically to any planetary or life event.

💡 Bottom line for spiritual/astrological practice:

South Node = past, comfort, karmic patterns, lessons.

North Node = future, growth, soul path.

Lilith = shadowed feminine archetype; integration brings strength and creativity.

Draconic / Lunar Node Horoscopes = tools for exploring past life themes and karmic lineage.

Eclipses & Moon phases = timing triggers for growth, release, or new beginnings.

If you want, I can draw a practical “cheat sheet” for the South Node, North Node, and Lilith in your chart—like a guide showing how to use these energies consciously instead of getting stuck in them.

Do you want me to do that?

Apex
Jump to navigationJump to search

Solar Apex in the constellation Hercules
The Apex - more precisely, the Solar Apex[1] - (abbreviation: Ap) is the focal point of the movement of our Sun (and thus the entire Solar System) in relation to the average of the nearby bright Fixed Stars.
It is located in the constellation Hercules, southwest of Vega. The opposite direction is called the Antapex; it is located in the constellation Dove.

Since the Apex does not correspond to any celestial body, it is considered a Sensitive Point in astrology.

Apex	53°26' N	0°45' Cap.gif	1°27' Cap.gif	2°08' Cap.gif	2°51' Cap.gif
It has been located at the beginning of Capricorn since about 1900, near the winter Solstice.

Astronomy
The first determination of the Apex was made in 1783 by William Herschel. From 1822, Carl Friedrich Gauss also calculated the Solar Apex using very different methods, but never published the calculations himself. Later, the most important calculation method was independently rediscovered by Auguste Bravais and George Biddell Airy. It was not until after 1900 that it became clear that a major difficulty in determining the Apex of the Sun's movement is based on the anisotropic velocity distribution of the stars. According to current values from the early 21st century, the Sun is moving at 19.7 km/s towards the Apex, which was located at a galactic longitude of 57° and a galactic latitude of 22°.

In reference to the Solar Apex, the focal point of the Earth's movement relative to the Sun is referred to as the Earth Apex in meteor observations. The Earth Apex moves along the Ecliptic of the Sun by about 90 degrees over the course of a year. Thus, it is particularly high in the sky during the early morning hours, which is why more meteors can often be counted in the second half of the night than in the first. From the Earth's perspective, one looks in the direction in which the Earth is moving at about 30 km/s. The dust particles that it "collects" can be seen particularly well as Meteors (shooting stars).

Astrology
In particular, Theodor Landscheidt conducted studies on the astrological significance of the Apex, summarized in his work "Fixed Stars, Aspects, and Galactic Structures"[2].

Mundane Astrology
Landscheidt noted: "In a mathematical-statistical investigation of the major earthquakes from 1904 to 1964, I observed, among other things, that at the time of the triggering of severe earthquakes, the Apex direction was unusually often occupied by important elements."[3] This result is particularly significant, as at that time the position of the Apex was not as precisely determinable as it is today, and Landscheidt still assumed a position of the Apex in the area of 0° Capricorn, as he further writes: "(...) the peak of the clustering does not exactly coincide with the standard Apex, but is 1°45' away from it. For the epoch 1950, according to this data, the ecliptic longitude of the Solar Apex is 1°45' Capricorn." This statement remarkably aligns with the position of 1°27' for the year 1950 given above.


Ludwig Erhard and the Apex[4]
Individual Astrology
For the individual, and thus for the interpretation of natal charts, Landscheidt provides the following general correspondence of the Apex: "The Apex as the endpoint of the Sun's own movement can be associated with the individual correspondence "Personal Goals." However, the Sun, with its flight direction in space, simultaneously determines the target axis of the cosmic movement of all Planets in the system; its Apex movement exerts a gravitational pull regarding the environment being drawn in a certain direction. For this, in the individual cosmogram, the correspondence "Guiding Force of the Personality" is characteristic."[5] Thus, he clearly associates the Apex with the Sun, but also beyond that, as the Earth moves - averaged over the year - towards the Solar Apex, since it orbits the Sun and thus must have the same direction of movement in space as the entire Solar System.

Since Landscheidt practiced cosmobiological astrology, he particularly focused on the 4th harmonic chart ("90° circle"). He finds significant correlations with this interpretive approach; he examines, for example, the horoscope of the then Federal Minister of Economics Erhard and finds strong connections to the Apex, with only a very small orb (see illustration). He writes: "The Mercury-Jupiter-Sun complex characterizes the successes achieved through scientific achievements in the economic field, Sun-Moon Node the connection with the public, and Venus-Jupiter-Sun the popularity as a statesman. The Apex, which is connected with all these factors, symbolizes the goals and the guiding force of the personality, which are further defined by the other interpretive elements."[6]

As further encouragement, Landscheidt cites Rudolf Tomaschek, suggesting that greater attention should also be paid to the aforementioned Earth Apex in astrology; however, no significant studies on this have yet been conducted. Galactic Center

The Galactic Center[2] (abbrev. GC) is the mass center of our Milky Way. Astrophysically, it contains the nearest known supermassive black hole and exhibits other unusual phenomena.

It lies in the constellation Sagittarius, where the visible band of the Milky Way appears densest. Tropically it is still in the zodiac sign Sagittarius and will not enter Capricorn until 2225.

The GC at radio wavelengths[3]
The constellation Sagittarius (Latin Sagittarius) contains an especially large number of stars and nebulae, but the Galactic Center itself is hidden behind dark “dust clouds” of interstellar matter. It cannot therefore be observed in visible light. Observations are possible, however, in longer wavelengths (infrared and radio) and in hard X-rays, because these waves penetrate dust far better.

The Galactic Center is also the center of rotation for all bodies in our Galaxy and can be inferred as such indirectly. The properties of the strong radio source Sagittarius A* at the Milky Way’s center indicate that it is a black hole.

At the very beginning of radio astronomy, in 1931, Karl Guthe Jansky detected radio emission from the direction of the GC. Sagittarius A* is located at Right Ascension 17h 45m 40.04s and Declination −29° 00′ 28.1″ (J2000.0). Toward the end of the 1990s, observations with the Chandra X-ray satellite provided the first detection of X-ray radiation from Sagittarius A*.

Evidence for a black hole arises from the properties of this radio source: it shines very brightly from a very small region, which cannot be explained by other kinds of radio sources. The evidence is still indirect. Astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics have determined the mass of this black hole with relatively high precision to be about 4.31 million solar masses.

Astrology

Sagittarius A*[4]
Since roughly the mid-twentieth century there have been proposals that the Galactic Center should also have astrological significance. Friedrich Bernhard Marby reports related ideas in his (unpublished) work on “Galactic Astrology.” Convinced of the GC’s importance, he even sketched an alternative zodiac whose beginning—0° Aries—falls at 27° Sagittarius in the tropical zodiac, which is quite close to the Galactic Center.[5]

The physicist and astronomer Rudolf Tomaschek pointed in his book Kosmische Kraftfelder und astrale Einflüsse to the astrological importance of the apex (the point toward which the solar system is moving), as well as the entire galactic disk (the Milky Way band), though not explicitly to the Galactic Center itself,[6] as Theodor Landscheidt noted in 1965 (p. 24). The astrologer-astronomer Landscheidt is known as the first to engage the Galactic Center directly, in his 1965 work Fixsterne, Aspekte und galaktische Strukturen.

His interpretive approach: “If we proceed from the working hypothesis that the Galactic Center (Z) is an important interpretive factor, we arrive at the following individual correspondences for Z: balance of the personality structure; attraction exerted on the environment.” (p. 30)[6]

For Konrad Adenauer, for example, he finds the MC at the Galactic Center and from this infers the stability of the Adenauer era and policies (p. 38).

Hans Taeger also took up this point in his Astroenergetik (1982).


The Uroboros[7]

Cudell’s book
More recently, Anabela Cudell has worked extensively on the Galactic Center; her book of the same name appeared in 2009. In one article she describes the GC’s effect thus: “The Galactic Center (GC) has the property … of connecting or mixing levels or domains. Hence, under a galactic influence, things sometimes come to light that one would not have expected—or even hoped for, in one’s most optimistic imaginings.”[8] In the book she writes: “Those who have a GC influence in the horoscope stand as if at the center of the black hole and can look into all dimensions. All dimensions and all lines of orientation converge in the GC.” Cudell continues: “This point is beginning and end at once[9] and also not; time stands still—or races ahead. (…) People with galactic influences in the horoscope are gifted in many ways. They have insight into many different fields and many manual skills. Herein often lies their drama and their difficulty in coping with our civilization. (…) The ‘galactic’ person may become chaotic and their fine, valuable abilities wasted. The galactic person links connections among overwhelming circumstances, associating strange things with each other.”[10]

Well-known figures with a strongly placed Galactic Center include Leonardo da Vinci and Bill Gates. Vertex
Jump to navigationJump to search

Vertex and Antivertex astronomically
The vertex of a horoscope is the westernmost point on the Ecliptic where it intersects the Prime Vertical. Because the Descendant, the principal west point in a chart, is set by a Great Circle passing through the visible horizon as well as the Midheaven and Imum Coeli; the vertex and descendant are two different points. The vertex has been likened to a second descendant in the chart, however.

In most charts the Vertex lies on the western side, i.e. in the houses near the descendant. In tropical latitudes with the Ascendant near the equinoxes, however, it can happen that the ecliptic rises vertically into the sky and lies nearly parallel to the Prime Vertical. Then both circles can intersect near the zenith and nadir. In such charts the Vertex appears close to the MC or IC, i.e. not western at all.

Interpretation
The vertex relates to fated or fateful events, notably encounters with highly influential people in an individual's life.

Its sign and house should indicate the nature of these seemingly destined events. Dates when the vertex is activated by Transit or Progression of planets to the vertex degree should indicate their timing, at least in hindsight.

The vertex also may give sensitive people glimpses into alternate realities. Part of Death
Jump to navigationJump to search

The "Part of Death" is a combination of Ascendant, Mars and Saturn[1]
One of the Arabian parts and sensitive points in the chart.

For daytime births it is calculated by adding the positions of the ascendant and Mars and subtracting that of Saturn.
For nighttime births Saturn is added to the ascendant and the position of Mars is subtracted from the total.

The part of death shows the point in the horoscope at which deep processes of transformation take place, which are often accompanied by intense feelings of anxiety.

Because of ethical and accuracy concerns about predicting death, the part of death plays virtually no practical role in modern (Western) astrology. Part of Fortune
Jump to navigationJump to search

Fortuna with the wheel of fortune[1]
Synonym: Pars Fortunae (Latin)

Symbol: a cross within a circle.

The PoF is the most widely used sensitive point in the horoscope, and one of the Arabian Parts. These, however, were previously used by Hellenistic astrologers, who called them "lots".

There are two different ways of calculating the part of fortune. Both require converting the zodiac signs into segments of the 360 degree wheel. For example, Aries occupies 0 to 29 degrees. For day-time births, the sun's degree is subtracted from the sum of the moon's degree and the ascendant degree. For night-time births, the moon's degree is subtracted from the sum of the sun and the ascendant degrees.

The part of fortune symbolises the harmonious relationship between the conscious aims (sun) and subjective feelings (moon) and their realisation in the present moment (ascendant). It is considered to be a good luck factor in a horoscope. Part of Love
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Lovers[1]
A sensitive point in the horoscope, and one of the Arabian parts. With daytime births it is calculated by adding the degrees of the ascendant and Venus and subtracting the degree of the sun from the total.

The part of love symbolises the harmony of conscious goals (sun) and awareness of one's own self-worth and the resulting ability to love (Venus) which finds expression in the present moment (ascendant). Part of Occupation
Jump to navigationJump to search

The "Part of Occupation" is a combination of MC, Moon and Sun[1]
One of the sensitive points in the horoscope and an Arabian part. In daytime births it is calculated by adding the degree positions of the Medium Coeli and the moon and subtracting the position of the sun. With night-time births the degree positions of the sun and MC are added and that of the moon subtracted from the total sum.

The part of occupation symbolises the relationship between conscious aims (sun) and subjective emotions (moon) and its concrete manifestation in the public sphere (MC). The MC and part of occupation address career in the sense of a vocation or one's public image, rather than a job with little meaning to the worker, which is a sixth house matter. Part of the Father
Jump to navigationJump to search
One of the sensitive points in the natal chart and one of the Arabian parts. In the case of daytime births, it is calculated by adding the degree positions of the ascendant to Saturn and subtracting the degree position of the sun.

In the case of nighttime births, it is calculated by adding the position of the sun to the ascendant and subtracting the position of Saturn.

In traditional astrology this part indicates the actual father of the native. In modern astrology it shows that point in the horoscope which is particularly sensitive to roles traditionally associated with fatherhood, such as taking on responsibility, giving support and self-confidence. Aspects to this point indicate how these energies will be expressed. Part of the Mother
Jump to navigationJump to search
A sensitive point in the horoscope and one of the Arabian parts.

The formula for daytime births is: add the degrees of the ascendant and moon, then substract the degree of Venus; and for nighttime births, the ascendant + Venus degrees - the moon's degree.

The part of motherhood[1] in traditional astrology did indicate something about one's actual mother.

In modern astrology, however, this part more generally shows the point in the horoscope that is particularly sensitive to themes such as nurturing, caring, emotional security and the process of letting go. Aspects to this point from planets indicate how these energies will be expressed. Part of the Mother

Example positions of Moon and Sun for a day birth: Sun and Moon lie above the horizon in the diurnal half. The Moon could, however, be below the horizon. Night-birth formula: Sun and Moon lie below the horizon in the nocturnal half. The Moon could also be in the diurnal half. For choosing the day vs. night formula only the Sun’s half matters.

Synonyms: pars fortuna; lot; wheel of fortune; lucky lot; older Greek term: Lot of Fortune (Tyche); gr.: τύχη.[2][3] The later Latin designation is “pars fortuna” (Lot/Part of Fortune).

The Lot of Fortune, regarded as a decisive point for “fortune” or “misfortune” in life, is still the most commonly used sensitive point in the horoscope. Already in ancient classical astrology it played an important role and is depicted by a cross within a circle (Symbolism).

Development
In antiquity the two luminaries (Sun and Moon) were taken as a metaphor for the “light of life” of the native, whereas the Horoskopos (later: Ascendant) represented vital force and life span or lifetime. These three life-determining factors were therefore presumably set into a celestial-mechanical relation, from which the following manner of calculation developed (the 17th-century interpreter Aegidius Strauch here follows the Ptolemaic view that planets, Sun and Moon convey physical forces):

“Concerning the Lot of Fortune, which astrologers likewise insert into the figure: one [method] counts from the Sun to the Moon—this they call the Ptolemaic—and another from the Moon to the Sun. The former is a certain point of the heavens to which the ray the Sun casts upon the Moon is so reflected that it equals the ray which the same Sun casts upon the Ascendant, and therefore it is as far from the Moon as the Ascendant is from the Sun. The latter is a point of the heavens to which the ray of the Moon cast upon the Sun is so reflected that it equals the ray which the same Moon casts upon the Ascendant, and therefore it is as far from the Sun as the Ascendant is from the Moon.”[4]

Similarly, Cyprian Leowitz writes of the Lot of Fortune: “§ 21 Ptolemy treats the Lot of Fortune no less than a planet, yet only assigns aspects to it insofar as planets behold it; for it is only that place in the heavens in which the rays of Sun and Moon meet.”[5]

The Ascendant is the point where the Ecliptic cuts the horizon. The eastern horizon (Ascendant) was the place that “received” the light from Sun and Moon and mirrored it into the zodiac at that longitude which corresponded to the arc of light between Moon and Sun—i.e., “reflected” from one half of the nativity into the other. Thus the computational logic of reflecting sunlight in proportion to moonlight depended on the lunar phase (the arc difference between Moon and Sun).

The logic behind Tyche was likely the origin of all further sensitive lots/parts. It was studied closely: if this “lot of the life-lights” was poorly beheld (aspected), it was considered a bad omen promising little “life fortune.” The literature offers differing opinions on its correct calculation. Some maintain Ptolemy gave only the diurnal formula; others say this is a misreading.[6] The often-cited diurnal/nocturnal distinction is: For day births the Lot of Fortune = Ascendant + Moon − Sun. For night births = Ascendant + Sun − Moon. See Sensitive Point for computational details.

Opinions varied widely: the Renaissance astrologer Aegidius Strauch always worked with two Fortune lots and made no diurnal/nocturnal distinction: Aph. 29: “Each of the two Fortune lots is found by using the true places of the luminaries and subtracting one from the other, but arranging them differently. For the first, counted from the Sun, place the Moon’s position first and the Sun’s beneath; for the other, do the reverse. After subtraction, add the remainder of sign, degree, and minute to the Ascendant to obtain each lot’s place.”[7] That Strauch truly used both lots alike is shown in his doctrine of transits: Aph. 63 (…) 2. “Transits of the Sun over the places of each planet and also over the Midheaven, the two Fortune lots, and the Ascendant (…)."[8]

Ptolemy on the Wheel of Fortune

Example with a 30° separation. The astronomical–mathematical principle is that the arc between Sun and Moon always equals the arc between Fortune and Ascendant, whether using day or night formula.
The various methods all amount to adding or subtracting the ecliptical separation between Sun and Moon to/from the Ascendant; therefore the distance between Lot of Fortune and Ascendant always equals the distance between Sun and Moon. The reflective relation of Moon–Sun light appears as a mirror-equal arc from Ascendant to Fortune.

Ptolemy in the Tetrabiblos, the chapter on the Lot of Fortune: “The Lot of Fortune is obtained from the number of degrees between Sun and Moon, both by day and by night, as follows: as many degrees as the Sun and Moon are distant from one another, so large is the interval from the Ascendant to the Lot of Fortune, measured in the order of the signs.


Ptolemy’s rule: ‘If the Moon follows the Sun in the order of signs, add the arc from the Ascendant’ (red); ‘but if the Moon precedes the Sun in the order of signs, subtract the arc from the Ascendant’ (blue).
At the end of this arc, counted from the Ascendant by the zodiacal order, lies the Lot of Fortune. (…) One must also observe which luminary follows the other in the rising of the signs: if the Moon follows the Sun in the sign order, add the arc to the Ascendant; if the Moon precedes the Sun in the sign order, subtract the arc from the Ascendant.”[9] Ptolemy then notes another rule from an unnamed source: “Perhaps of equal value is a note stating that for night births one should measure from the Moon to the Sun and, contrary to day births, subtract the arc from the Ascendant.”[10] These ambiguous statements have fueled debate to this day: at one point he emphasizes the rising order of Moon and Sun; at another, whether the Sun is above (day) or below (night) the horizon.

Nechepso-Petosiris on the Lot of Fortune
Cited by Vettius Valens:

“… as the King [Nechepso] enigmatically declared at the start of his 13th book: ‘Then for those born by day one must clearly count from the Sun to the Moon, and again from the Hour-Marker [Ascendant] count off an equal number and see which star the resulting place assigns and how or which are configured with it; one must also observe how the quadrangular or triangular configurations are fixed upon the whole. (2) From this knowledge of the places you will clearly judge the circumstances of the natives.’ Likewise Petosiris, in his ‘Horoi’ (Boundaries), clarified the topic …”[11]

“11. On the influence of the Lot of Fortune upon the place indicating life span; with an example; and here also the least years of the stars. (2) In his 13th book the King [Nechepso], after the introduction and the arrangements of the signs, speaks of the Lot of Fortune, from Sun, Moon and Hour-Marker, and prides himself greatly upon it, mentioning it throughout and treating it as a principal point, about which he again and again speaks in riddles: (3) ‘The Sun begins each day from the East and hands over the vault, completing the circle in the West, as is seen. But when night comes, the Moon is not continuously the light-bearer; sometimes it appears in the evening and then sets, sometimes it remains for a portion of the night, sometimes it traverses the whole night; hence, following the Sun, it hands over the circle completely.’”[12]

“Count from the transiting Sun to the Moon at birth and count off the same number from the Hour-Marker; (2) and wherever it ends, observe whether the ruler of that sign is in operative signs, compare stars that oversee or aspect it, benefics or malefics; (3) also note the days from the transiting Moon to the Sun according to the nativity and take the same number also from the Hour-Marker.”[13]

“And the King said at the beginning of his <13th> book: ‘Then one must carefully count from the Sun to the Moon; again (others say: conversely) from the Hour-Marker establish the equality and observe which star the departing ruler encountered and which stars are present with it; for from the knowledge of the places one may clearly judge the fates of the natives.’”[14]

According to Neugebauer and van Hoesen, the Valens paraphrases correspond to algebraic relations such as F = AS + Moon − Sun, etc.[15] Alfred Witte later termed such expressions planetary pictures.[16]

In late antiquity and thereafter in classical astrology, the Lot of Fortune—its place in the Horoscope, its sign position and aspects from the classical planets—was thought to exert great influence on a native’s circumstances. Claudius Ptolemy accorded Tyche extraordinary importance and directed it by primary directions. Placidus De Titis also valued it highly, while Johannes Kepler rejected it. As usual in late-antique practice, one also considered the house and sign of the lot’s ruler. Cyprianus Leovitius (b. 8 July 1524), court astrologer to Elector Otto Henry of the Palatinate, writes in his aphorisms (§ 410): “The Lot of Fortune signifies wealth and bodily constitution; likewise does the ruler of the Lot of Fortune, whoever that may be.”[17]

In general the lot was connected with material conditions[18], the body and outward life circumstances[19], well-being, nourishment and welfare[20]. This was related to the Moon’s influence on growth, fertility and earthly life, sometimes also—stereotypically—to feminine concern with bodily care. Valens (2nd c. CE) derives its meaning by stating “that in the cosmos the Moon is fate and pneuma, as it circles and influences the Earth and thus similarly rules the human body.”[21]

The 13th-century Italian astrologer Guido Bonatti writes of the lot, among other things:

“This point signifies life and body, and also the soul, strength, fortune, substance and gain—that is, wealth and poverty—gold and silver, heaviness and lightness of things bought in the marketplace, fame and good report, honor and recognition, good and evil, present and future, the hidden and the manifest; and its signification applies to all and sundry. It befits the rich and powerful more than others, yet its testimony pertains to everyone according to the state of each matter. If this point and the luminaries are well placed in nativities or progressions, it will be particularly advantageous. This point is called the Moon’s point, or the Ascendant of the Moon, and it promises fortune.”[22]

Early depiction of Fortune
Along with AC, MC, Sun and Moon, it was one of the indicators for vitality/longevity (Hyleg), e.g. in Claudius Ptolemy.[23]

Starting from the lot, Manilius in the Astronomica divided the Zodiac into twelve equal sections, the so-called Lots/Parts.

In the 20th century, Martin Schulman associated the Lot of Fortune with “positive karma” (in vol. 3 of his Karmic Astrology[24]). The motto: where one can express the Lot of Fortune, one “feels at home” and recognizes one’s place in life.
ChatGPT said:
Ah, perfect—this is a goldmine of sensitive points and “fixed star-adjacent” astrology. Let’s break it down and highlight the key structures and distinctions so you can see the layers clearly:

1. Solar Apex
Astronomical meaning: The Solar Apex is the direction our Sun moves relative to nearby stars, currently in early Capricorn (around 2° in 2000–2050). The opposite direction is the Antapex in the constellation Dove.

Speed: Sun moves ~19.7 km/s toward it.

Astrological meaning:

Sensitive point, not a physical object.

Guiding force of personality, personal goals, cosmic “pull” on life direction.

Especially studied in mundane astrology (earthquakes, global events) and cosmobiology.

The Apex interacts with your natal planets to show how you pursue goals or attract opportunities.

Key figure: Theodor Landscheidt—connected Apex with success, influence, and popularity in public life (example: Ludwig Erhard).

2. Galactic Center (GC)
Astronomical meaning: Mass center of the Milky Way, contains supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Tropical zodiac: Sagittarius.

Astrological meaning:

Represents centrality, insight, multidimensional awareness, and the ability to “see connections” across layers of reality.

Associated with balance of personality and attraction exerted on environment (Landscheidt).

Can indicate a person’s capacity to navigate chaos while holding insight across multiple domains.

Well-known examples: Leonardo da Vinci, Bill Gates.

Interpretive angle: Linking your life, vision, and impact to universal, systemic forces.

3. Vertex
Astronomical meaning: Westernmost intersection of ecliptic and Prime Vertical.

Astrological meaning:

“Fated encounters” or turning points with influential people.

Sensitive to timing by transit/progression of planets.

Can hint at glimpses into alternate realities or karmic connections.

4. Arabian Parts / Sensitive Points
These are calculated “derived points” rather than physical bodies—mathematically reflecting relationships between planets, ascendant, MC, etc. They represent life themes:

Sensitive Point	Calculation (Day / Night)	Meaning
Part of Death	Day: Asc + Mars − Saturn; Night: Asc + Saturn − Mars	Transformation, crises, intense anxiety, hidden endings
Part of Fortune (Pars Fortunae)	Day: Asc + Moon − Sun; Night: Asc + Sun − Moon	Material fortune, life flow, wellbeing, “feeling at home” in life
Part of Love	Day: Asc + Venus − Sun; Night: Asc + Venus − Moon	Expression of love, harmony of self-worth and relationship
Part of Occupation	Day: MC + Moon − Sun; Night: MC + Sun − Moon	Career, vocation, public impact
Part of Father	Day: Asc + Saturn − Sun; Night: Asc + Sun − Saturn	Father figures, authority, responsibility
Part of Mother	Day: Asc + Moon − Venus; Night: Asc + Venus − Moon	Mother figures, nurturing, care, emotional security
Interpretive note: Modern astrology uses these as symbolic overlays on life themes rather than literal predictors of events (except maybe Part of Fortune for timing opportunities).

5. Core Principles Across Sensitive Points
Many of these points work as “mirrors” of planetary dynamics: you take distances or arcs between planets (Sun, Moon, Ascendant, MC) and create a derived point.

Diurnal vs nocturnal formula: the Sun’s position relative to the horizon shifts the calculation, reflecting the Moon–Sun polarity in life expression.

These points are particularly powerful for timing, karmic patterns, and hidden forces in the chart.

How they tie together
Solar Apex: Life direction, personal goals, your “cosmic trajectory.”

Galactic Center: Multidimensional insight, influence on environment, ability to synthesize chaos.

Vertex: Fated encounters and karmic turning points.

Arabian Parts: Layered life themes (love, fortune, vocation, parental roles, transformation).

Takeaway: These are all sensitive markers of influence, not literal planets—but they shape the way the Sun, Moon, and other planets express themselves in your chart, pointing to underlying patterns of fate, purpose, and personal guidance.

If you want, I can make a visual map of all these points in a natal chart style, showing how Apex, GC, Vertex, and key Parts might interact together. It’s like giving your chart a “multidimensional overlay.”

Part of Fortune

Fortuna with the wheel of fortune[1]
Synonym: Pars Fortunae (Latin)

Symbol: a cross within a circle.

The PoF is the most widely used sensitive point in the horoscope, and one of the Arabian Parts. These, however, were previously used by Hellenistic astrologers, who called them "lots".

There are two different ways of calculating the part of fortune. Both require converting the zodiac signs into segments of the 360 degree wheel. For example, Aries occupies 0 to 29 degrees. For day-time births, the sun's degree is subtracted from the sum of the moon's degree and the ascendant degree. For night-time births, the moon's degree is subtracted from the sum of the sun and the ascendant degrees.

The part of fortune symbolises the harmonious relationship between the conscious aims (sun) and subjective feelings (moon) and their realisation in the present moment (ascendant). It is considered to be a good luck factor in a horoscope. Revised Astrology

Ring's depiction of Saturn (1921).
In Germany, the term Revised astrology ("Revidierte Astrologie") has been introduced and extensively used by some astrologers of the twentieth century for their particular revision of classical astrology. This article refers to their use of the term.

Thomas Ring and Herbert Freiherr von Kloeckler wrote important works which contributed to the further development of astrology in the 20th century.

Ring challenged the idea that there could be a mechanical explanation for the influence of celestial bodies. He also rejected rigid rules of interpretation and any kind of determinism or event predictions. Furthermore, he spoke of the limitations of astrology and did not believe that a horoscope was capable of showing an individual's time of death, his sex, level of maturity or intelligence. Revised astrology has influenced many branches of modern astrology, in particular psychological astrology.

Ring had a different approach to aspects than classical astrology, too. He rejected judgmental interpretations and classified aspects as either "analytical" (instead of "difficult") or "synthetic" (instead of "good").

He developed his own characteristic terminology to describe the signs of the zodiac and the planets. The same term is used for signs in the same element: Fire, for example, is described as volitional; earth as material; air as mental and water as emotional. The following list shows the properties of the signs as the energy that:

Aries: volitionally propulses
Taurus: forms the material basis
Gemini: mentally fluctuates
Cancer: is emotionally creative
Leo: volitionally attracts
Virgo: is materially limiting
Libra: is mentally directive
Scorpio: is emotionally tense
Sagittarius: volitionally directional
Capricorn: materially moves
Aquarius: mentally orders
Pisces: emotionally partakes
The ten planets are described as follows:

Sun: the creative life-force
Moon: the dreamlike
Mercury: Intelligence
Venus: the Aesthetic
Mars: Instinctive energy
Jupiter: that which gives meaning
Saturn: that which sets limits
Uranus: that which initiates change

Often the rising sign tells a lot about a person's identity.
The branch of astrology which concentrates on interpretation and prognosis for the horoscopes of individuals. Central to the astrology of individuals is the natal chart cast for the location, date, and time of birth; as well as other horoscopes derived from it.

The astrology of individual nativities has been important in western astrology since it was introduced into Greece from Babylon around the 3rd century BCE. Contrary to popular belief that ancient astrologers reserved natal chart interpretation for aristocrats, individual astrology appealed to a mass audience and street fair practitioners throughout the ancient Roman empire.

The astrology of individual nativities is distinct from studying the charts of current events (mundane astrology), planning favourable times to undertake activities (electional astrology) and casting charts for the moment of specific questions (horary astrology.) Popular sun-sign columns are actually an extremely simplified version of natal chart interpretation. With today's focus on individuals' self-awareness and self-improvement, the astrology of personal nativities is the most popular type of modern western astrology. Cycle of Development

Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs, represented as a pyramid with the more basic needs at the bottom[1]
In addition to processes specific to an individual which can be examined using various predictive methods such as transits and secondary progressions, there are cycles of development that are common to all. These are shown by the cycles of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The following cycles are considered to be the most important.

The twelve year cycle of Jupiter when it forms a conjunction to its natal position is seen as marking a new cycle of growth
The cycle of Saturn, which marks important phases in maturity in which a critical appraisal and recognition of past achievements often occurs, takes 29 1/2 years to form a conjunction with its position in the natal chart. These themes are also triggered roughly every 7 years when Saturn forms important aspects to its natal position - the waxing square, the opposition and the waning square. This seven year cycle plays an important role in many traditions
It takes Uranus 84 years to traverse the Zodiac, and at around 42 years, it forms an opposition to its natal position, while at 21 it forms a waxing square and at 63 a waning one to its natal position. These aspects represent stages of emancipation which are often characterised by times of crisis. Above all, these are times when we need to come to terms with newly found freedom. The so-called mid-life crisis is common around the age of 42 and marks a time of transition into the second half of life. Several important transits occur at the same time: the Uranus-Uranus opposition (this can only happen once in a lifetime), the second Saturn-Saturn opposition and the Neptune-Neptune square which, like the Uranus opposition, also happens only once in a lifetime. As would be expected, so many transits occurring at the same time leads to a variety of questions concerning: newly found freedom at the height of professional success (Uranus); bidding farewell to youth and contemplating growing older (Saturn); unfulfilled wishes and longings (Neptune). It is possible to experience the (only possible) Pluto-Pluto square around this time so that the individual is also likely to be confronted with suppressed themes that come to form the so-called Shadow. The Pluto-Pluto square can, depending on the generation the individual is born in, occur a few years earlier or in other cases up to two decades later in life due to Pluto's extremely eccentric orbit during which it spends between 14 and 32 years in one sign of the Zodiac. For this reason, the Pluto-Pluto square is not, as opposed to the other transits mentioned here, tied to any particular chronological phase in life. Psychological Astrology

History
Several astrologers pursued the theories of Carl Gustav Jung in their writings, teachings and practice. One of the first astrologers to combine Jungian psychology with astrology was Dane Rudhyar and his protégé, Alexander Ruperti.[1] Rudhyar termed it "humanistic astrology," the subject of his monumental volume, The Astrology of Personality, published in 1936.[2] Psychological astrology, however became firmly established in the late twentieth century with the books and lectures of Liz Greene[3] and Stephen Arroyo[4] who were both strongly influenced by the Jungian model.[5] In 1983, Liz Greene and Howard Sasportas, a psychosynthesis psychotherapist, founded the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London.[6]

In Switzerland, Bruno Huber & Louise Huber developed their own method of astrological psychology, referred to as the Huber Method which was influenced by Roberto Assagioli's work with psychosynthesis. In 1962, the Hubers founded the Huber School of Astrology and their work is now taught at the Astrological Psychology Association.[7]

In the 1970s, in his twelve-volume series, The Principles and Practice of Astrology (Llewellyn 1975), Noel Tyl has allied the psychological need theory with astrological symbolism. This analytical blend is developed fully in his book Holistic Astrology - The Analysis of Inner and Outer Environment (1980). In the light of the psychological need theory, he interprets the horoscope "as a process of lifelong conditioning, where individuals are predisposed to present individualized needs to the environment. This processs identifies how we act, who we are, and how we fit into the world. Fulfilling destiny, in modern terms, is fulfilling needs."

Contents (Ethics)
Psychological astrology considers the horoscope to be a reflection of the soul, or personality in a broad sense. Its aims are to help individuals gain a better understanding of themselves and to accept all sides of their personality: the "good" and the "bad".

When psychological astrologers interpret a horoscope and give advice, they will generally try to avoid being judgmental. They emphasise taking personal responsibility for one's own actions and the importance of Free Will. An individual's everyday life is not seen as ruled by malefic or benefic planets as the horoscope is considered a mere tool to help identify an individual's nature and potential for psycho-spiritual growth. Psychological astrology concentrates on life's opportunities; it shows the possible difficulties reflected in the horoscope, but tries to help people to find constructive ways of actualising their inner potential.

A consultation with a psychologically orientated astrologer is not equivalent to psychotherapy, however. Many astrologers have immersed themselves in the ideas of psychology, with a number holding degrees in psychology, but they are not necessarily licensed psychologists or psychotherapists. Conversely, although some licensed psychologists work with astrology, this is often done in secret to avoid discrimination from colleagues or the risk losing their job. Astrological Schools
Jump to navigationJump to search

FAS Logo
Within astrological circles there are many different methods of interpretation and areas of specialisation. Some of these have become so systematic and institutionalised that they have developed into separate schools of thought. The schools are as varied as astrology itself. Some emphasise the connection between astrology and psychology, others concentrate on methods of prediction or what factors trigger events. This fact is also reflected in a wide variety of methods used. Certain schools of thought place an emphasis on factors that receive scant attention from the majority of astrologers such as Midpoints, Minor Aspects, Sensitive Points, Trans-Neptunians and Isis (Transpluto).

The most important astrological schools in Germany are:

The Aalen School (Cosmobiology)
The Astrological-Psychological Institute (API or Huber School)
The Hamburg School
The Cosmobiosophical Society
The Munich Rhythm Method
The School For Transpersonal Astrology (TPA)[1]
Alongside the above schools there are occupational organisations such as the German Astrologers Association (Deutscher Astrologen Verband/ DAV) or the Swiss Astrological Association (SAB), which intend to offer serious education in a variety of different astrological techniques.

There are also many equivalent English language organisations, including the AFA (American Federation of Astrology), AFAN (Association for Astrological Networking), ISAR (International Society for Astrological Research), NCGR (National Council for Geocosmic Research) and the Uranian Astrology (Hamburg School). Babylonian Astrology

Cover of Rochberg’s Heavenly Writing[1]
The cradle of astrology and astronomy stood in the land between the rivers (Mesopotamia). Babylon was one of the largest and most important cities of antiquity.[2] The study of the stars flourished there millennia ago,[3] and many of its essential modern features were already developed. The legendary “Three Magi” of the New Testament are described as “wise men from the East” and star-interpreters, likely from Babylonia.

Astronomy
The Sumerians based their calendar on astronomical configurations. The earliest evidence of a lunisolar calendar (which takes both Moon and Sun into account) comes from their realm and is nearly four thousand years old.


Akkadian depiction including the Ecliptic (Cancer, Leo) and Saturn
At that time, astrologer-astronomers played an important role in religion and politics. They were priests or temple staff, learned scribes, interpreters of signs, physicians, and scholars—also responsible for cultic matters such as rituals, magical incantations/invocations, and divinations.
Their sky observations took place on large stepped structures directly adjacent to the temples, the so-called ziggurats. Around 600 BCE all important celestial cycles were known with astonishing accuracy: among other things the synodic month, the orbits of Venus and Mars (with only minimal errors), and probably the Metonic cycle. The identity of Venus as evening and morning star was known at least since the 17th century BCE. By the eighth century BCE, specialists also clearly understood the 18-year Saros Cycle of Eclipses.
In mathematical terms, in the Old Babylonian period of the second millennium BCE they developed our system of counting hours (twelve double-hours per day), including minutes and seconds, as well as the 360° division of the circle (the sexagesimal system). In everyday life, time was measured using Sundials or a shadow stick (gnomon).

In astrological technique this later led—among the geometrically inclined Greeks—to the theory of angular relationships or Aspects (see Hellenistic Astrology). The Trine at least is already attested among the Babylonians for the fourth century BCE.[4]


Ziggurat[5]
The star-watchers’ observations and data collections were regular, detailed, and systematic—empirical records for later evaluation and the interpretation of omens. Carefully maintained archives preserved records reaching back to the third millennium BCE. Thousands of recovered cuneiform tablets are astronomical in nature, composed in three sentences, and duplicated as needed up to about 300 BCE. From the period 2300–687 BCE, the MUL.APIN[6] tablets list the heliacal risings of Planets, Fixed Stars, and Constellations, the equinoxes and solstices, plus comet names; the tablets were evidently a widely used reference work among scholars in that land.

Religious-studies scholar Gustav-Adolf Schoener writes: “In 1847, near the ruins of Nineveh, the completely preserved library of King Ashurbanipal (king of 669–626 BCE over Assyria and Babylon) was found. This library with over 4,000 astrological clay tablets shows us an astonishing systematics of astronomical observations and their astrological interpretations. The astrologers proceeded as follows: an observation in the sky was recorded with date and time of day and accurately described in terms of its characteristics. In parallel, all political events and natural occurrences were recorded as well. The same was repeated continuously, and in this way, over many centuries, continuous registers were created that meticulously compared celestial phenomena with events on earth, checked them against older templates, and supplemented them with new observations.”[7]

It is assumed that the Greek astronomer Eudoxus of Cnidus used many of these data for his star catalogues, as did Ptolemy in his Almagest. Based on long observation series, the Babylonians developed mathematical procedures that enabled the calculation of the positions of celestial bodies (as full ephemeris tables) and thus the prediction of celestial phenomena such as New Moons and Conjunctions.[8] Hipparchos, the greatest Hellenistic astronomer, was strongly influenced by this.[9]

Planets and Gods
Babylonian cosmology distinguished three “heavens.” Only the lower two levels were visible to humans: the middle heaven of Enlil, where the chief god Marduk/Bel had his dwelling, and beneath it that of Ea, where the movements of stars and planets could be observed.[12] In the dynamic polytheistic system of Babylonian religion, it was crucial to discern the gods’ will in time. Alongside natural phenomena and the condition of sacrificial animals’ entrails, it was increasingly the movements of the heavenly bodies from which the divine will was sought over the course of Babylonian history. Contrary to popular assumptions, the planets (including Sun and Moon) were not themselves deities, but merely heralds of the divine will.[13]

Assigned in the late period were:

Shamash — Sun
Sin — Moon
Ishtar (Inanna) — Venus
Marduk — Jupiter
Nabu — Mercury
Nergal — Mars
Ninurta — Saturn

Divination
Around 1000 BCE the astrological omen series Enuma Anu Enlil (EAE) contained seven thousand omens with astronomical information on seventy tablets. First steps toward determining auspicious days (electional astrology) already existed in the third millennium BCE.[15] In particular, Eclipses were interpreted as negative, threatening, and dangerous for the state and ruler.
Planetary paths with their inexplicable loopings were understood religiously as expressions of the gods’ will, which had to be deciphered. The gods were not seen as identical with the planets, but they at least dwelt on the heavenly bodies. Astrologers were to “consult the gods,” who communicated with humans through signs—such as the positions of the heavenly bodies. In this as precise as possible reading of the “writing of the firmament,” the development of astronomy was virtually a by-product, an auxiliary science of star divination.

The intellectual background was the hermeneutic principle of Microcosm and macrocosm (“as above, so below”), the assumption of a correspondence or Synchronicity between the “Great Whole” and the individual situation/question, the idea of a meaningful order or Quality of time operating everywhere in the cosmos. Francesca Rochberg: “The Babylonian horoscopes are an extension and improvement of the birth omens.”[16]

The liver horoscope

The solar system on a Sumerian artifact[17]
The Babylonian liver horoscope was a forerunner of the later horoscope.

It involved examining the liver of a freshly slaughtered sheep for omens. In the oracle scheme/interpretive system used for the liver analysis one can discern the basic features of the later horoscope: there was a division into the four corners (cardinal directions/Quadrants); the east corresponded to the Ascendant, the west to the Descendant. And “the naming of liver valleys and mountains with designations from the starry world emerged.”[18] A collection of 32 tablets with labeled liver models from c. 1875 BCE contains the earliest known texts on Babylonian divination—and these show the same interpretive format as that used in the analysis of sky omens.[19]

The Zodiac
Before the ecliptic was adopted in Babylon as the astronomical-astrological reference, orientation followed the so-called “path of the Moon” with its stellar background and the 11 to 18 constellations found there (the number varied). The complete zodiac with its—still uneven—twelve constellations along the ecliptic was finally developed in the fifth century BCE in Mesopotamia during the Achaemenid Empire, or at least first transmitted then. The various sections were named after nearby stars and configurations. In the fourth century BCE, probably already under Seleucid rule after the Hellenistic conquest, the exact division of the zodiac into twelve “signs” of 30° each developed, together with, for the first time in antiquity, mathematical astronomy that enabled the advance calculation of planetary positions based on the coordinate system of the 30° sections of the individual signs.[20][21] The Sidereal Zodiac itself—with its twelve equal 30° sections and its beginning at Aries—may have arisen because it was modeled on the schematic “ideal calendar” of twelve months of 30 days, with the Babylonian year beginning near the spring equinox perhaps from the seventh century BCE, and on the parallel constellations.[22] Precursors of this symmetric structuring of the zodiac were (around 1100 BCE) the so-called “astrolabes”[23]—circular representations of heliacal star risings, trisected and then quartered again.[24] The zodiac remained sidereal, although Precession may already have been discovered two hundred years before Hipparchus by the Babylonian astronomer Kidinnu.[25]

Nine of today’s signs correspond unchanged to the original Sumerian months with their names and divisions (Capricorn was still a goat-fish). Astrologically, a planet’s hypsoma or exaltation is the zodiac sign or point at which the planet exerts its greatest effect. In Egyptian astronomy, the Sun as the embodiment of Re achieved its greatest plenitude of power in Aries. In the earlier Babylonian astrology, the position of a planet at the “hidden place” (bit nisirti)—unlike the Greek use—signified that this planetary position was a favorable omen. Moreover, for the Babylonian “hidden places” no zodiacal degrees are specified, and in some cases planets are said to be “in the hidden place” even though their concrete position does not correspond to the zodiac sign of the “hidden place.”[26] The hypsomata of the planets in the twelve-part zodiac with 30° sections likely did not arise before the fifth century BCE, as the twelve-part zodiac is first attested in Babylon in the fifth century BCE.[27]

Mundane Astrology
Planetary motions were used to forecast the economy and price developments, for example for barley,
and also to predict weather phenomena.


Veneration of the sun-god Shamash[28]
Natal Astrology
In the final phase of Babylonian astrology, around the fifth century BCE, natal astrology arose, which noted the planetary positions on the day of a birth, as finds of small cuneiform tablets show. These are tablets listing the planetary positions in the zodiac on the day of a birth, occasionally with brief sayings regarding individual planets or planetary configurations—the omens. In a few cases, degree-exact positions of the planets in the signs are given.[29] The tablets did not yet provide horoscopes in the modern sense, among other reasons because neither the Ascendant nor, accordingly, the houses are mentioned on them.[30] A typical example of a cuneiform tablet with the planetary configurations of a birthday for a person named Anu-belsunu, date X.2 of year 63 S.E., i.e., 29.12.249 BCE, reads:

1. Year 63 Tebetu, evening of the (?) second day
2. Anu-belsunu was born.
3. On this day the Sun was at 9.30° Capricorn,
4. The Moon was at 12° Aquarius: His days will be numerous.
5. Jupiter was at the beginning of Scorpio: Someone will help the prince.
6. [The child (?)] was born [i]n (?) Aquarius with / or in the region of (?) Venus: He will have sons.
7. Mercury was in Capricorn; Saturn in Capricorn;
8. Mars in Cancer.

Lion-subduer Enkidu[31]
The person named Anu-belsunu could be identified as a descendant of a “scribe of Enuma Anu Enlil,” who in turn had appeared as an author of astrological texts. This shows that in the Seleucid era cuneiform tablets with birth configurations were also produced for people of higher social strata, not only for rulers.[32] The oldest preserved cuneiform tablet listing the day configurations of a birth is dated to 1409 BCE.[33]

The Babylonian priest Berossos produced, in the third century BCE under Hellenistic influence, a history of Babylon preserved fragmentarily and indirectly, with some astrological and cosmological elements.[34] Berossos is said to have settled around 300 BCE on the island of Kos and founded there the first astrology school of the Hellenistic world.[35] He did not yet teach natal-horoscope astrology as it developed from the second century BCE in Hellenistic Egypt (the Ptolemaic kingdom), especially in Alexandria.[36]

Magical Astrology
The principle of analogy was taken very concretely (i.e., magically) by the Babylonian priest-astrologers even in their late period, as in the following episode from 323 BCE:

When all the signs in the sky pointed to Alexander’s death, his astrologers, without the ruler’s knowledge, used the principle of the substitute king: they sent a prisoner into his camp, who, to the Greeks’ utter astonishment, sat on the throne. He was then interrogated and executed. Unfortunately it did not help: Alexander the Great died shortly thereafter a sudden death.[37]

Wow, you’ve basically dumped a mini-encyclopedia on astrology! 😅 But it’s actually really interesting because it spans a huge spectrum—from Hellenistic and Babylonian astrology to modern psychological astrology, including Revised Astrology and individual horoscopes. Let me summarize and clarify the main points so it’s easier to digest:

1. Part of Fortune (PoF)
Also called Pars Fortunae, symbolized as a cross in a circle.

Originated in Hellenistic astrology, later used in Arabian astrology.

Calculated differently depending on birth time:

Day births: (Moon + Ascendant) - Sun

Night births: (Sun + Ascendant) - Moon

Represents the harmonious relationship between conscious goals (Sun), feelings (Moon), and real-world expression (Ascendant).

Seen as a luck factor in the chart.

2. Revised Astrology (20th Century Germany)
Key figures: Thomas Ring & Herbert Freiherr von Kloeckler

Focused on:

Rejecting rigid determinism and mechanical interpretations.

Emphasizing personal growth over “good/bad” predictions.

Classifying aspects as analytical (instead of “difficult”) or synthetic (instead of “beneficial”).

Sign & Planet descriptions highlight qualities/energy, e.g.:

Aries: volitional propulsion, Leo: volitional attraction, Virgo: materially limiting, etc.

Planets: Sun = life force, Moon = dreamlike, Jupiter = meaning, Saturn = limits, etc.

3. Individual (Natal) Astrology
Focuses on birth charts for personal identity, psychology, and life guidance.

Distinct from:

Mundane astrology (world events)

Electional astrology (choosing auspicious times)

Horary astrology (answering questions)

Sun-sign horoscopes are a simplified version of this.

4. Life Cycles & Planetary Cycles
Jupiter: 12-year cycle → growth and opportunity.

Saturn: 29.5-year cycle → maturity, evaluation, and 7-year sub-cycles.

Uranus: 84-year cycle → emancipation, freedom crises (mid-life around 42).

Neptune & Pluto: Trigger shadow work, life-long transformational themes.

5. Psychological Astrology
Influenced heavily by Jung.

Key figures: Dane Rudhyar, Liz Greene, Stephen Arroyo, Huber Method.

Focuses on:

Chart as reflection of the soul.

Understanding, accepting, and integrating all aspects of personality.

Empowerment and free will over deterministic predictions.

Not a replacement for psychotherapy, but can complement it.

6. Astrological Schools
Germany: Aalen (Cosmobiology), Huber School, Hamburg School, etc.

English-language: ISAR, NCGR, AFA, AFAN, etc.

Emphasis varies from psychology to prediction techniques to sensitive points and minor aspects.

7. Babylonian Astrology
Birthplace of modern astrology and astronomy.

Observations were:

Rigorous, precise, empirical.

Documented on clay tablets (MUL.APIN, Enuma Anu Enlil).

Key contributions:

Sexagesimal system → 360° zodiac

Divination, electional astrology, lunar-solar calendars.

Zodiac and planetary exaltations developed over centuries.

Planets = messengers of gods, not gods themselves.

Early natal astrology emerged around 5th century BCE.

Magical astrology: using analogies to influence outcomes (like the substitute king example with Alexander the Great).

So, in short: this collection traces astrology from its Babylonian roots, through Hellenistic and Revised interpretations, into modern psychological astrology, and touches on the Part of Fortune as a key point in understanding luck and life potential.

If you want, I can make a visual “timeline/flow chart” showing all these developments, including how PoF, Revised, and psychological astrology fit into the bigger picture of astrology. It would be like connecting the dots from Babylon to today.

Do you want me to do that?

Hellenistic Astrology
Jump to navigationJump to search

Ptolemy had a major impact on the development of astrology[1]
This term means both the type of astrology practiced in the Greek and Roman empires between roughly 300 BCE and 600 CE, as well its revival today by some Traditional Astrology practitioners. Of the ancient astrologers whose names survived Antiquity, many lived in Alexandria, Egypt and nearby provinces. They wrote in both Greek and Latin, but because Roman astrologers were deeply influenced by Greek culture, the term Hellenistic is appropriate.

History
The Babylonians invented horoscopic astrology, probably around 700 BC, as the outgrowth of centuries of looking to the heavens for celestial omens foretelling the future of king and country. The Babylonians named the seven planets visible to the naked eye; developed the concept of Sign as 30-degree segments of the heavens that roughly correlated to the Constellation for which they were named; marked Conjunctions, Oppositions, and Eclipses; and understood planetary Exaltation. They invented the Ephemeris as a means of predicting planetary positions at times when they were invisible.

Around 280 BC a Babylonian astrologer named Berossus moved to the Greek Island of Kos and began to teach astrology. The Greeks, like many ancient societies, previously developed an elaborate body of star lore and used the rising and setting of constellations to predict weather changes. The Greeks also invented the mathematics and astronomy necessary to refine the timing of horoscope points, together with philosophies in which individuals could understand the events in their lives in relation to the cosmos.

There were probably separate movements of astrological lore from Babylon through Persia to Egypt, which became a Greek colony in 332 under Alexander the Great. The Egyptians, previously developed a detailed system of interpreting the stars, as they seemingly rotated in the heavens, as a calendar that could be used to time religious festivals and agricultural activities. They believed that the stars rising at the moment of a person's birth significantly influenced the outcome of his life. Their religious beliefs about the sun as a god who rotated through the sky in a series of stages may be the origin of the astrological Houses.

Probably as a fusion of these different influences, a new horoscopic astrology emerged around 150 BCE, with a dazzling new array of techniques. The details of its historical development are few, but within the space of a few centuries, Hellenistic astrologers mapped houses; examined aspects; calculated "lots" (Arabian Parts); checked fixed stars; and applied various calculations to determine planets' relative strength and influence over various areas of life.

Most of the Hellenistic astrologers' works have been lost, but are known through what others said about them. Claudius Ptolemy (Tetrabiblos), 2nd century CE) became the best known to subsequent traditional astrologers because Arab astrologers picked up his work directly after the demise of the Roman Empire. Manilius, Dorotheus of Sidon, Vettius Valens, Firmicus Maternus, and Rhetorius the Egyptian also wrote extensive astrological treatises available in English translation .Classical Astrology

The seven Klassical planets[1]
The term "classical" is sometimes applied to the various periods of western horoscopic astrology practiced from the time of the ancient Greeks to the mid-nineteenth century; as well as to astrologers today who prefer the older methods developed prior to modern or revised astrology. The term is not restricted historically to the Classical period of Antiquity or to other cultural products such as Classical music.

Many astrologers prefer the term Traditional Astrology. Traditional Astrology

Calculating Persian astrologer Mashallah[1]
Traditional Astrology is a catch-phrase for the main types of western astrology practised prior to the mid-19th century. It includes the Hellenistic Astrology of the Greeks and Romans, Arabian, Medieval, and Renaissance European systems of astrology. It is sometimes known as Classical Astrology; which does not imply restriction to a Classical period of western history or culture.

Traditional astrology nearly died out in the 1800s and was largely replaced by western Modern Astrology (Revised Astrology) methods by the turn of the 20th century. Traditional astrology is gaining in popularity today, however, often as a combination of different historical techniques in the hands of its practitioners.

The early twentieth century "modern" astrologers hoped to revive astrology, but they disliked traditional astrology's seemingly negative view of human nature and people's negligible prospects for improving their lives. Moreover, becoming a temple-robber, shipwreck victim, or owner of runaway slaves were apparent problems in the past, but have limited relevance for modern urban society. The pioneers of modern astrology essentially streamlined traditional astrology by ignoring many of its techniques; and instead interpreted planets, signs, aspects, and houses through the teachings of psychology or human potential movements. Astrology witnessed a strong revival in the 1970s, including in the hands of practitioners who based their interpretations more on common-sense understandings of human character than allegiance to particular schools of thought.

By the 1990s some astrologers became disatisfied with what they saw as modern astrology's dismissal of astrology's historical foundations, its apparent lack of structure, and its overly optimistic view of human perfectability. Others hoped to retrieve old astrological texts from obscurity by translating them into English. Horary Astrology, which had little place in psychological interpretations of personality, gained a new following.

Today traditionalist and modern astrologers still wage major debates over which branch is best. However, many traditionalists today use modern tools (such as the outer planets) and intepret human character and events in ways that are decidedly oriented towards modern cultural values; while some modern astrologers apply traditional western and Hindu methods in their work. Moon's Nodes

The moon's nodes as seen from the earth[1]
Symbols:
A36_153.gif (north node/ Rahu), A37_153.gif (south node/ Ketu)

The moon's nodes are not physical planetary bodies but the points of intersection between the sun's apparent orbital path around the earth, the ecliptic, and the moon's orbital path around the earth.

Astronomy
There are two points of intersection which are situated directly opposite each other, forming the nodal axis. These points of intersection occur because the plane of the moon's orbital path is inclined to the sun's (in reality the earth's)orbit at an angle of 5 degrees and 9 minutes. The moon can be located either north or south of the plane of the ecliptic.

The point at which the moon crosses the plane of the ecliptic when moving in a northerly direction is called ascending moon's node or north node. Two weeks later the moon intersects the ecliptic plane going in a southerly direction and this point of intersection is called the moon's south node.

The series of moon's nodes move in a clockwise (i.e. retrograde) direction around the zodiac and take 18 years, 7 months and 9 days to make one complete revolution. Eclipses occur when either the new or full moon occurs close to the nodal axis.

Ephemerides often give two different values for the moon's node: for the so-called mean moon's node and the true moon's node. The former is an average value and is always retrograde. The true moon's node, on the other hand, continually changes direction, although it also usually moves in retrograde motion through the zodiac. The true moon's node, contrary to its name, is not always an accurate value because the moon does not follow an exact ecliptic path around the earth.

Some astrologers prefer to work with the true moon's nodes, while others use the mean value. In any case, the two are never separated by more than 1.5 degrees of arc.

In some horoscopes only the ascending node is shown, although the descending node is always situated opposite.


The Nodal Axis
Mythology
Astrologers of the past envisioned the earth as surrounded by a cosmic dragon who swallowed the sun or the moon during an eclipse. This idea gave rise to the terms Dragon's Head (Caput Draconis, or ascending moon's node) and Dragon's Tail (Cauda Draconis, or descending moon's node). This imagery also appears in Indian Astrology with Rahu, the dragon's head; and Ketu, the dragon's tail. The Hindu god Vishnu is credited with beheading a serpent demon, called Rahu. Both parts of the serpent are immortal, however, and capable of concealing the light of the sun and moon.

In Indian astrology, the nodes are considered shadow planets, constituting two of the nine Navagrahas, or heavenly bodies that influence life on earth. The mythology of the nodes arises from a mythic tale contained in ancient Sanskrit texts, where the nodes are portrayed as the severed head and tail of a great dragon. Medieval western astrologers also utilized this dragon imagery, and referred to the nodes as the head and tail of the dragon — one which increases good or bad, another which drains and empties out good or bad.

Interpretation
The moon's nodes, as the points at which the paths of the sun and the moon cross, represent a symbolic merger of the sun and the moon, or the meeting of two (masculine and feminine) poles.

The descending or south node is associated with the past, whether in the karmic sense of things brought over from past lives into the present one, or in the sense of the influence of the past in the present life, such as one's inherited traits and childhood. The south node may also show an area of life where the person is proficient, but yet where little further growth will occur: the person's "comfort zone." It is not necessary to believe in karma and reincarnation to work with the moon's nodes.

The ascending or north node stands for the future or direction in which the person should develop. This direction may be similar to the rest of the chart, or it may suggest new and unfamiliar territory. The challenge is not to leave behind the south node but to achieve a balance between the two, whereby the experience gained at the south node can be used to further the development of themes represented by the north node.

The ascending node is sometimes associated with Jupiter and the descending node with Saturn. Saturn may be related to the south node in the sense that it is often associated with the past, difficult topics (Shadow), and compulsive patterns of behaviour, whereas the ascending node is associated with opportunities to grow, after facing up to the themes associated with the south node. Another planetary comparison is that the north node equates to the solar principle and the south node to the lunar one.

The moon's nodal axis symbolizes an overriding central theme in the horoscope. For an individual person the house positions of the two nodes indicate important areas of life or domains of activity, whereas the signs indicate their styles or modes of activity.

The descending node reflects childhood experiences, particularly those present from an early age. Because they are so taken for granted, the individual may be tempted to fall back into familiar and at times obsessive behaviour patterns when confronted with new challenges. This behaviour may also lead to negative experiences which can leave the child - or later adult - with feelings of inadequacy. When this happens the behaviour pattern can have addictive traits while offering only apparent but not real security.

At the same time the themes symbolised by the north node may appear to be a shining ideal which, however, requires great effort to achieve. With increasing age the individual usually becomes more aware of the calling to reach this goal, particularly between the ages of 18 1/2 and 37 when the transiting moon's nodes return to their positions in the natal chart. An individual remains largely unconscious of the themes associated with the south node while (ideally) striving to achieve the themes associated with the north node. However, this goal can only be reached if a balance is achieved between the two poles.

Planets which are conjunct the descending node or in square aspect to the nodal axis are generally difficult to cope with and are often experienced as deficits. The challenge is to find new and creative ways to express them. The Swiss astrologer Claude Weiss stated that: "The person who is able to let go of the past is the one most able to find constructive ways of expressing planets conjunct the descending moon's node, and with this he transcends the apparent contradiction between the descending and ascending moon's nodes. He/She then experiences planets conjunct the descending node as if they were conjunct the north one because he/she has managed to free him/herself from a linear understanding of time."

Planets which are conjunct the ascending moon's node or in harmonious aspect to the nodal axis can help an individual to rise to the challenge represented by the south node and costructively explore those new aspects of life symbolised by it. Indian Astrology

Vishnu is the primary Devata for the Sun in Vedic thought, notably in the form of Surya-Narayana[1]
The message boldly blazoned across the heavens at the moment of birth is not meant to emphasize fate – the result of past good and evil – but to arouse man’s will to escape from his universal thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now prevalent in his life. He can overcome any limitation, because he created it by his own actions in the first place, and because he has spiritual resources which are not subject to planetary pressure.
Sri Yukteswar[2]

Synonyms: Vedic astrology, Hindu astrology, Jyotish

The term Jyotish or Jyotisha is the original word for “astrology” in India. In Sanskrit the term is written as ज्योतिष (jyotiṣa). In Sanskrit it means “the science of heavenly bodies,” although it is sometimes interpreted differently as “the science of light.”

Indian astrology is a unique synthesis of Babylonian and Hellenistic elements combined with elements of the Hindu religion as handed down in the Vedas. They therefore have a similar basis to Western astrology. But the completely different cultural and religious environment that confronted the Babylonian star gazers East of the Indus led to the development of a different system that at first glance seems foreign to Europeans.

Around 1500 BCE Indo-Germanic peoples populated the North-West part of the Indian subcontinent. They called themselves Aryans (= noble ones) and were the founders of the Hindu religion. Central to this belief were the ideas of Karma, the belief in reincarnation and a hierarchical caste system. The belief that an individual's fate was the result of past deeds and had to be fatalistically accepted became widespread. This also influenced the development of Indian astrology.

When they conquered India, the Aryans came into contact with a high culture of Dravidian peoples in the Indus valley and the descendants of prehistoric nomads known today as the Adivasi (= indigenous people). These pre-Aryan peoples had a well-established Moon cult; however, little else is known about their astrological system.

In contrast to the other main Asiatic system, Chinese Astrology, Indian astrology is based on the well-known zodiac signs developed by the Babylonians. In addition, they use the seven (classical) planets and the rising and descending Moon's Nodes. This results in nine important points, an especially popular number in Indian mythology. The planets are associated with the same days of the week as in Western astrology. Indian astrology also uses a system of twelve houses and their rulers and the aspects between the planets.


Spiritual master Sri Yukteswar (1855-1936)[3]
This is where the similarity with Western astrology ends. The unique form of Indian astrology has been strongly influenced by Hinduism, but also by other, older traditions.

The most significant differences to Western astrology lie in the role of the Moon and the Moon's Nodes, the use of the Sidereal Zodiac, the order and numbering of the houses, the further division into numerous segments and planetary periods together with individual methods of prognosis and interpretation which are closely linked to the theory of Karma.

The Moon has particular significance in Indian astrology. It is not just one among many celestial bodies that make up the luminaries but the most essential one. Indian astrology could even be described as lunar astrology because of the tradition to divide the zodiac into 27 Moon houses of 13 degrees 20 minutes each. These are poetically described as the "27 Women of the Moon". In Hindi they are called Nakshatras. The length of a Moon house is exactly equal to the average movement of the Moon during the course of one day. In Indian mythology, the Moon is wed to 27 sisters and visits a different one each day. On its journey it becomes ever weaker till it reaches the lowest point at which it recovers and its energy increases. The Moon's house position has a particularly important influence on terrestrial life. Put simply, the waxing Moon is considered to be beneficial and the waning Moon detrimental.

Great significance is also attributed to the Moon's North and South Nodes. The North Node is called Rahu, the South Ketu. They are considered to be very negative. In mythology the Moon's Node was a dragon that wanted to overthrow the gods. The attempt failed because the Sun god decapitated the dragon. But beforehand the dragon had drunk from the immortal nectar and so the head became immortal.

The recently discovered outer planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) play a peripheral role at most in Indian astrology, although some astrologers include them in their calculations. The majority of Indian astrologers work with a horoscope based on the sidereal zodiac. The deviation in relation to the tropical zodiac caused by the Precession of the Equinoxes is called ayanamsha.

Exemplary East-Indian Chart
Indian astrology uses an equal House System with the rising (= ascendant's) degree as the mid-point of the house. And it can be with overlapping signs alike the western Placidus system.which, in contrast to house systems used in Western astrology, runs in a clockwise direction.

Houses can be geomatrically finetuned where the houses can be slightly smaller or bigger few degrees more or less.

Signs suggest how a planet will behave and whether elevated-debilated etc. Houses indicate the agenda/ subject matter of the house, while the Lord of the house cusp is the Lord of the house.

The planetary aspects are from sign to sign, however.

And the graphic portrayal is rectangular.

A further distinctive feature is the division of the zodiac and planetary orbits into ever-smaller segments. The most common are the decants which are segments of 10 degrees and Navashmas which are segments of 3 degrees and 20 which result from dividing the signs by the mythical number nine while also representing one quarter of a Moon house. These methods are used to refine the process of prognosis. Another method designed for this purpose is the division of a life-span into so-called Dashas, which are themselves further divided into periods called Bhuktis. The Dashas are calculated according to the position of the Moon in the horoscope.

Finally, Indian astrology has been influenced by many of the concepts that have also influenced Western astrology. The planets, signs and houses are viewed in a strongly judgmental way. The fifth and ninth houses are considered to be especially beneficial, the twelfth stands for loss, the sixth is antagonistic. This rigid correlation paves the way for determinism. The common interpretation of the concept of Karma also strengthens this fact. The present life must be accepted as the consequence of former lives. The horoscope shows the basic disposition and nothing can be done to change this. If everything is already predetermined, astrology simply has the role of revealing the future. Insofar prognosis is the most important area of application.

The modern, emancipated branch of Hindu philosophy does not agree with the idea of determinism. It maintains that Karma is created in every moment, so that each individual is an active creator of their own fate. On this understanding, astrology takes on an altogether different significance. Instead of revealing the inevitable, it can reveal favourable and unfavourable times for particular actions and offer creative solutions.

The time of death is a central element of prognosis in Indian astrology. The subject of death is far less taboo in India than in the majority of Western countries. The people are more at ease with the subject. From a Hindu point of view the prognosis of the time of death is often considered to be a great help in planning to improve one's Karma for the following life. It is common practice for people to erect a horoscope for the time of death because it is thought to reveal aspects of the next incarnation. Sidereal Zodiac
Jump to navigationJump to search

Astronomical Observatory at Delhi/ India[1]
In the sidereal zodiac the signs of the zodiac overlap extensively with the star constellations which they were named for. The sidereal zodiac is most commonly associated with Indian astrology (also known as Vedic or jyotish astrology).

Western astrologers generally work with the tropical zodiac where the start of the zodiac at the spring equinox and 0 degrees Aries is defined as the point at which the sun crosses the celestial equator in a northerly direction on its apparent path around the earth.

There is a less clear definition in the sidereal zodiac. The precession of the equinoxes causes the sidereal zodiac to move one degree every 72 years in relation to the tropical zodiac. The standard ayanamsha value or divergence between the two zodiacs was 23 degrees, 51 minutes and 11 seconds on first of January 2000 (according to N.C. Lahiri). Using this value, 0 degrees of Aries in the tropical zodiac is equivalent to 6 degrees, 8 minutes and 49 seconds Pisces in the sidereal zodiac. However, some ayanamshas deviate from this value by several degrees, such that a planet at tropical 27 degrees of a sign could be at 0 degrees of the sidereal sign.

Both the tropical and sidereal zodiacs are divided into twelve equal segments of exactly thirty degrees. The sequence of signs is identical, although their interpretations vary somewhat between India and the West. Horary Astrology
Jump to navigationJump to search

Choosing the right moment is not an easy task[1]
Synonym: Astrology of the moment

Horary astrology is also known as interrogational astrology. It is a branch of astrology that uses a horoscope to answer concrete questions.

In India it is known as prashna (or prasna), which means “question” in Sanskrit.

In Arabic it is known as masa’il, which means “questions” or “interrogations”.

History
Some have speculated that it was the latest branch to have been established, with some of the earliest complete texts on horary dating to the early Medieval period (5th through 8th centuries CE).[2]

Method
A chart is erected for the moment a question is posed or for the moment that the astrologer understands the Querent's question; and, ideally, for the astrologer's location.[3] Questions usually concern a particular decision or event in which the individual is unsure of the outcome, for example in health matters, profession, relationship, or travel. There is almost no limit on questions so long as they are not trivial, misleading, or immoral/illegal. Examples of horary questions are, "Will we get married?", "Where is my missing cat?", "What will be the outcome of my anticipated career move?"

Horary astrology is consequently not specifically concerned with the querent's birth horoscope, its perivatives, personality, or self-awareness. Some modern horary astrologers, however, do recommend looking at both the horary chart of the moment and the natal chart for a more complete picture of the issue facing the native.

The astrologer concentrates less on the horary horoscope as a whole and more on those aspects or specific Significators which are relevant to the client's question. These are usually limited to a few planets, signs and houses. The horary horoscope can only be interpreted in relation to the client's question.

Interpretation (rules)
Many horary astrologers observe further limitations, understood as outright prohibitions against interpreting the chart, or as simple cautionary guidelines. For example, if the Ascendant is between 1 and 3 degrees or 27 and 30 degrees of a sign of the zodiac, some horary astrologers consider the timing to be too early or late to answer the question. Others argue that such a chart can be read if certain situations apply, or even if the chart otherwise appears to address the question.

As with elections, where the aim is to find the most favourable time astrologically speaking, interpretation in horary astrology is done along the lines of traditional or classical astrology. For example, both branches still work with the classical system of Rulers, even though more modern horary astrologers do take Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into consideration. Both systems still divide aspects into helpful and unhelpful; although most horary astrologers use only the Major Aspects. Horary astrology contains a significant number of guidelines for chart interpretation, unlike the more impressionistic modern Psychological Astrology.

Horary astrology aims to give the most concrete answers possible, which is the reason for such strict rules of interpretation. It would be inappropriate to offer a psychological interpretation of such a horoscope.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’ve essentially pasted a detailed overview of Hellenistic, Traditional, Indian (Vedic), and Horary astrology. Let me break it down into a digestible, comparative summary for clarity, because there’s a lot packed in there. I’ll also point out the key differences and overlaps:

1. Hellenistic Astrology (c. 300 BCE – 600 CE)
Origins: Greek and Roman empires, especially Alexandria. Fusion of Babylonian (planetary cycles, signs, exaltations) and Egyptian (calendar, religious timing) influences.

Key Features:

Horoscopic astrology: charts cast for the moment of birth.

Planets & Signs: Seven classical planets, 12 zodiac signs.

Houses: Likely derived from Egyptian solar stages; 12 houses mapped to life areas.

Techniques: Aspects, planetary strength, Lots/Parts (e.g., Part of Fortune), fixed stars.

Famous Figures: Ptolemy (Tetrabiblos), Vettius Valens, Dorotheus of Sidon, Manilius, Firmicus Maternus.

Legacy: Arab astrologers preserved and expanded this system after the fall of Rome.

2. Traditional / Classical Western Astrology
Definition: Broad term covering Hellenistic, Arabian, Medieval, and Renaissance astrology.

Shift: Nearly disappeared in 1800s; modern Western astrology (psychologically-oriented) streamlined traditional techniques, often removing deterministic elements.

Modern Revival: Combines historical methods with modern sensibilities, occasionally incorporating outer planets.

3. Moon’s Nodes (North & South)
Astronomy: Points where Moon’s orbit intersects the ecliptic; retrograde motion; complete cycle ~18 years.

Mythology:

Western: Dragon swallowing Sun/Moon during eclipses → Dragon’s Head (North Node), Dragon’s Tail (South Node).

Indian (Rahu & Ketu): Severed dragon head/tail, immortal.

Interpretation:

South Node: Past, comfort zones, karmic patterns, skills already mastered.

North Node: Growth, life direction, potential, challenges.

Harmonic Aspects: Conjunctions or squares to nodes indicate karmic opportunities or obstacles.

4. Indian (Vedic / Jyotish) Astrology
Origins: Babylonian + Hellenistic influences fused with Hindu philosophy, Aryan religion, karma, reincarnation.

Key Differences from Western Astrology:

Zodiac: Sidereal (aligned with stars) vs. Tropical (Western, equinox-based).

Moon & Nodes: Moon has primary importance; 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions); Rahu & Ketu (nodes) have strong karmic influence.

Houses: Equal divisions based on Ascendant, clockwise; can include decans and smaller segments.

Dashas: Planetary periods for timing life events, linked to Moon’s position.

Determinism vs. Free Will: Karma is key; modern Vedic approach emphasizes co-creation of fate.

Outer Planets: Generally peripheral in Vedic astrology.

5. Horary Astrology
Purpose: Answer specific questions by casting a chart at the moment the question is understood.

Method: Focuses on relevant planets, houses, and aspects. Often ignores natal chart unless for context.

Interpretation Rules: Strict; timing matters; uses classical techniques (Rulers, Major Aspects); less psychological than modern Western astrology.

Application: Concrete answers to decisions, missing objects, relationships, career, etc.

Key Comparative Takeaways
Feature	Hellenistic	Western Modern	Vedic	Horary

 Heliocentric Model
Jump to navigationJump to search

Geocentric (normal) chart of Barack Obama
Most astrology practiced today is based on a geocentric model which depicts the earth as the center of our solar system, as it appeared to both ancient astrologers and people today gazing at the heavens.
A heliocentric model places the sun at the center of the solar system, in accordance with astronomical principles developed by the German-Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) five hundred years ago.

The Copernican World-View
Although the Greek astronomer Aristarchos postulated the idea of a heliocentric solar system in the third century BCE, the concept remained in relative obscurity up until the Middle Ages. The church as well as scientists supported the geocentric model, although speculation concerning the heliocentric model never completely disappeared.

The astrologer Regiomontanus (1436-1476) left some unpublished manuscripts suggesting he discovered the principle of heliocentrism. The research of Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and James Bradley subsequently confirmed the heliocentric model.

Astrologers today continue to work with the geocentric model, not through ignorance of the sun-centered solar system, but because planetary movement as seen from a human, earth-based standpoint forms the basis of their calculations. A geocentric horoscope is simultaneously a stylized version of the heavens and a symbolic depiction of an earth-based human character or an event. Astronomers today also use a geocentric model for particular purposes, such as calculating how far a distant star is from the earth, or the gravitational pull of the moon on the earth's surface. With exploration of the solar system and beyond, it is also possible to construct charts centered on a space station or another planet.

The Heliocentric Horoscope

Obama's Heliocentric chart
The heliocentric chart differs from the geocentric chart in that it does not show the sun, since the sun is the vantage point for the entire chart. The Earth is shown as a planet, in a position always 180 degrees opposite the sun in the geocentric natal chart. The planets may appear in different signs, because the backdrop of a planet varies when viewed from a solar perspective. There are no chart Angles and no houses in a heliocentric chart, since the earth is the basis for house division.

Because so few astrologers work with heliocentric horoscopes, there is little agreement as to their interpretation. Philip Sedgwick, in one of the few books published on heliocentric astrology, takes a soul-centered, evolutionary approach. Apart from the earth, the other planets would have the same meanings as in a geocentric horoscope.

Calculation
In order to create a harmonic horoscope the 360 degree circle is divided by the number of the particular harmonic. It is theoretically possible to do this with any number, but in practice the most common harmonics astrologers work with are the 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th.

In the following, the number 5 (i.e. the 5th harmonic) is used to illustrate the principle: The 360 degree circle is divided into 5 segments. The resulting aspect is the quintile (72 degrees); the fifth harmonic is concerned with the quintile and bi-quintile. Each of the 5 segments contains the whole zodiac, always starting at 0 degrees of Aries. These five segments are then laid on top of each other so that the planets which form quintiles or bi-quintiles to each other in the original chart come together. What remains is a 72 degree segment which is then expanded out again to form a whole circle. That is the 5th harmonic horoscope. All the planets that formed quintile or biquintile aspects in the natal chart now come together to form conjunctions. Any resulting oppositions were semi-quintiles (36 degrees) in the natal chart and a trine in the harmonic chart was a 3rd of a quintile (24 degrees) in the natal chart.

The following procedure is used to calculate the positions of the planets, Ascendant and Medium Coeli in the harmonic chart: The absolute number of degrees of each horoscope factor is multiplied by the harmonic number - in this case 5. (The absolute number of degrees is always measured from 0 degrees of Aries; for example, the absolute number of degrees for 23 degrees of Gemini is 83 degrees). If the result is a number larger than 360, then 360 is subtracted as many times as is necessary from this number until a number below 360 is reached. This number gives the position of the horoscope factor in question.

The age factor is determined by the number of days since birth, divided by the length of the tropical year. Each ecliptic longitude is multiplied by the age factor, and then reduced with modulo 360 to the range [0..360]. The reference place makes no effect, as the age harmonic chart operates purely with the birth chart.

Interpretation
As might be expected, number symbolism is an important factor when it comes to interpretation: The number of the harmonic and the aspect resulting from the division of the circle - in the above example the quintile - indicate the quality of the theme in question.

The most significant planets in the harmonic horoscope are those that form a conjunction because they resonate most closely with the harmonic number. The next factors to consider are those planets that form other major aspects because they also share a common wavelength.

The harmonic is kind of lens through which you can read something about the person. For example, the septile supposedly indicates inspiration plus discipline, and is common in charts of members of the clergy and composers. It seems to be a more spiritual aspect. So if you want to know about someone's spirituality or creative inspiration, run the 7th harmonic chart. Hard aspects will show what is challenging or difficult in this domain for the person, and the trines will show what flows easily for them.
Christoph Schubert-Weller comments that: "A strong 4th harmonic indicates above all the challenge of self-integration but also the strive for concrete success. A strong 5th harmonic is above all linked to an active, constructive and formative approach to the world of form. The 7th harmonic emphasises the artist, the creative person. But the 7th harmonic is also more strongly associated with criminal behaviour. A strong 9th harmonic indicates idealistic, religious and at times paranormal capabilities. The 9th harmonic is associated with wisdom and composure.  Chart Rectification
Jump to navigationJump to search

Grasping the exact moment - a difficult job, indeed
The reconstruction of a Time of Birth, usually through timing important events in the person's life, and correlating them with hypothetical house cusps or Axis. Many astrologers consider an exact birth time to be indispensable for an accurate natal chart interpretation, as determination of the rising sign, as well as locating planets and signs in houses, depend upon an accurate birth time. The accuracy of some predictive methods such as Primary Directions depends on the birth time being accurate to within a minute.

Unfortunately truly accurate official records of the time of birth are uncommon in western countries. Some birth registries record only the date of birth, and even a hospital record of the birth time might be rounded. Perhaps a person's mother remembers him being born "around 1:00" or only "late at night." (Accurate birth times seem more common in India, perhaps because of the greater acceptance of astrology there.)

In the past, determining accurate birth times was sufficiently difficult that astrologers pursued Horary Astrology as a means of answering practical questions. It is calibrated to the moment of the question being asked, which the astrologer could more easily determine once clocks came into widespread use.

Chart rectification "by hand" is a time-consuming exercise. There are now various computer programmes designed for chart rectification which makes the task easier and considerably less time-consuming. However, there is no objective external verification that a rectified time is, in fact accurate. Some astrologers argue that chart rectification based on concrete events is contradictory in spirit to esoteric and psychological astrology, which concentrate more on inner psychological processes rather than concrete events.

When the exact time of birth is unknown, the astrologer usually begins by inquiring about important events in an individual's life: for example, an important examination, wedding, birth of a child or the death of one of the parents. Then, with the help of various prognostic methods such as Transits, Solar Arcs, and Secondary Progressions (it is advisable to use more than one method;) the astrologer looks to see whether these events occurred at the same time as important Triggers on the Axis, or hypothesized cusps of houses whose meanings correspond to particular events. These are the most individual factors in the horoscope because a small change in the time of birth causes them to move by several degrees. The Ascendant and Medium Coeli (MC) move on average one degree of arc every four minutes.

Modern astrologers generally prefer the Placidus house system as being most sensitive to the timing of life events.

The following examples suggest how astrologers attempt chart rectification:

For each trigger which is thematically related, a hypothetical ascendant or MC is calculated, depending on which axis is triggered. Suppose the (non-rectified) ascendant is estimated to be in mid-Capricorn based upon an obviously rounded recorded birth time, like "around 2:00." On the native's wedding date, Saturn was at 16 degrees 15 minutes Cancer, i.e. near the corresponding Descendant or cusp of the seventh house of marriage. The hypothetical ascendant would therefore be set to 16 degrees 15 minutes Capricorn. The underlying hypothesis is that the event and the trigger can be exactly timed, which may be true in some but not all cases.
A similar process is carried out using the MC as the basis. For example, perhaps the Capricorn rising person moved house (an Imum Coeli or fourth house matter) or received a major career promotion (a MC matter) when Jupiter was in mid-Libra.
The astrologer will continue this process with various life events. For example, the birth of a child should be a fifth house matter. After several iterations of placing the person's life events in appropriate houses and applying different predictive methods to them, the astrologer sets a birth time on the basis of which value appears to give the most accurate results.
Some astrologers will also try to rectify a chart on the basis of the native's physical appearance, but it becomes even more difficult to separate out the effects of genetics, where family members share physical traits regardless of their rising signs, than it does to time events. First house planets or planets aspecting the actual ascendant will also have an effect on the person's physical appearance.Electional Astrology

General
A method in which the astrologer attempts to determine the best time – based on favourable Horoscope Factors – to begin a specific activity.

Because there are never perfect horoscopes for a given activity, the emphasis is on avoiding unfavourable chart placements. Electional astrology is similar to horary astrology, with which it overlaps, in its understanding of the horoscope as a dynamic entity, rather than a static moment in time. Like the latter, electional astrologers often work with the traditional astrological rulers, for example Mars as the ruler of Scorpio, rather than Pluto; Saturn of Aquarius and Jupiter of Pisces. Other methods of interpretation also have their origins in classical astrology. When electional astrology is undertaken as a type of horary astrology (i.e, based on the moment of a question,) rules of interpretation are as clear and precise as the predictions are concrete, although the natal chart and current transits of the individual concerned are also taken into account.

It is important to have as accurate a time as possible in order to ascertain the most favourable date, given how rapidly house cusps change in the course of a day. The best moment for a wedding, for example, could be the moment at which both partners sign the marriage certificate at the registry office or take the marriage vow during the wedding. However, it is not always possible to give the exact time for an event. An example would be emergency surgery, in which it might only be possible to avoid a few negative chart placements.

Electional astrology claims that an undertaking or event that begins under favourable horoscopic circumstances is more likely to have a positive outcome.

History
A rudimentary form of electional astrology was used by the Babylonians beginning sometime after the 16th century BCE. This and other Babylonian forms of astrology were passed on to the Egyptians, and Persians; Early Vedic astrologers also used a sophisticated form of electional astrology known as Muhurta (Muhurat) that was used for choosing the start of yajnas, travel, warfare, marriage and in modern times even filmmaking (muhurat shot) etc.

This technique was more widespread in the past when there was a greater belief in Determinism. Historically used primarily to schedule battles, electional astrology has been used by its proponents to plan a number of events, including weddings and trips.

The foundation of the city of Bagdad in the year 762, for example, is pretty well documented: the astrologers of Caliph al-Mansûr chose the date of July 31st, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in order to have Sagittarius rising.[2].

Modern electional astrology can in general be traced directly back to Book Five of Dorotheus of Sidon's treatises in Greek on the subject, Carmen Astrologicum from the 1st Century CE. This is the oldest treatise on electional astrology.

This method was developed by the German astrologers Peter Orban and Ingrid Zinnel in the beginning of the 1990s. Return Chart
Jump to navigationJump to search

The perpetual change[1]
A chart erected for the time a planet returns to its position in the natal chart, which is based on its orbital motion.

The most well known return horoscope is the solar return chart which occurs annually on an individual's birthday, which is the time that the sun returns to the position in the natal chart. It is closely related to the theme of self-development, a solar theme, for the year ahead.
The lunar chart, which occurs once a month and represents the time that the moon returns to its natal position, indicates likely emotional developments over the coming month - a lunar theme.

Also fairly common are the Mercury return chart, Venus return chart and Mars return chart. The first two are valid for one year, the latter for two.

The Jupiter return occurs every twelve years. A Saturn return happens roughly every 29.5 years. Uranus returns to its natal position every 84 years, and Neptune and Pluto will not return to their natal positions in the course of a human life span.

Interpretation
The natal chart should always be taken into account when interpreting return charts.
In each case the themes of the return chart relate to the themes represented by the planet: its house position and aspects (the sign is the same as in the natal chart) form the basis for chart interpretation. For example, a Venus return highlights relationships. The Saturn return coincides with the maturation of the individual. At about age 29, she leaves the world of young adulthood and enters middle age. In her late fifties, she contemplates retirement and old age.

Calculation
Unlike the sun and the moon, the other planets have periods of retrograde motion which strictly speaking means there should sometimes be three return charts. However, the last of the three is the most significant because it is valid for the longest period and for this reason is the one used for interpretation purposes. The process becomes problematic when a planet returns to its natal chart during its stationary phase because it is then virtually impossible to calculate the exact position of the Ascendant and Medium Coeli and therefore also the house cusps.

Got it! You’ve pulled up detailed explanations of the heliocentric model in astrology, plus related topics like harmonic charts, chart rectification, electional astrology, persona charts, and return charts. Let me break it down for clarity and context so it’s easier to digest and see the patterns across systems:

Heliocentric Astrology
Traditional astrology is geocentric: Earth-centered, reflecting how planets appear from Earth. That’s what most Western astrology uses.

Heliocentric astrology is sun-centered: Sun at the center, Earth becomes just another planet.

Differences:

No houses or angles (Ascendant/MC) in heliocentric charts.

Planet positions can shift relative to the signs compared to geocentric charts.

Mostly used for soul-centered or evolutionary interpretations rather than personality psychology.

Harmonic Charts
A tool to highlight hidden planetary relationships by dividing the zodiac into segments:

4th harmonic → self-integration challenges, practical success.

5th harmonic → creativity, constructive action, shaping the world.

7th harmonic → spiritual or artistic inspiration (and sometimes eccentric/criminal tendencies).

9th harmonic → wisdom, idealism, spiritual insight.

Planets that form conjunctions in the harmonic chart resonate most strongly with that number’s “theme.”

Chart Rectification
Used when birth time is unknown or approximate.

Method: Use significant life events and see which Ascendant/MC positions align with them astrologically.

Accuracy is crucial for predictive techniques (Primary Directions, Solar Arcs).

Often combined with natal chart analysis for best results.

Electional Astrology
Choosing the best moment to begin an action (e.g., surgery, wedding, launching a business).

Focuses on avoiding negative chart placements rather than achieving a perfect chart.

Historically used for battles, important events, city foundations.

Techniques overlap with horary astrology, using traditional planetary rulers.

Persona and Return Charts
Persona charts: Treat each planet like it has its “birth moment” — the first transit of the Sun over that planet’s natal position.

Return charts: Track when a planet returns to its natal position to mark cycles:

Solar return → yearly themes (birthday).

Lunar return → monthly emotional cycles.

Other planets → longer cycles (Saturn ~29.5 years, Jupiter ~12 years, Uranus ~84 years).

Key takeaway: Modern astrology uses a mix of methods — geocentric for personality and predictive work, heliocentric for soul/evolutionary insight, harmonic charts for creativity/spirituality analysis, and rectification/electional charts for timing accuracy. Each tool complements the others, depending on your focus (psychology, destiny, timing, or soul growth).

If you want, I can make a side-by-side visual chart showing geocentric vs heliocentric vs harmonic vs return charts, which makes it crystal clear how they relate and differ. It’s like seeing the same sky from four different dimensions.

Prediction
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Astrologer who Fell into a Well Prognoses are a risky job, indeed[1]
Pre-diction (literally fore-tell or pro-gnosis = fore-knowing) is one of the most fascinating aspects of astrology while also being responsible for astrology's bad reputation at various times throughout history. For many laypeople astrology is nothing other than prognosis, which is not true. It is mainly concerned with understanding human nature.

First of all, it is important to understand how astrological prediction works. The natal chart is a graphical representation of the position of the planets at the time of birth. It describes the energies present at birth which then evolve and develop over the course of an individual's life. Triggers such as transits, secondary progressions and eclipses indicate when a particular aspect of the personality is likely to develop or undergo some kind of transformation. The triggered horoscope factor in the natal chart will indicate what themes are involved while the trigger will indicate how these will be affected.

Basically, every horoscope factor (and trigger) is a symbol which can become manifest in many ways, and as long as the relationship to the underlying idea remains, the possible spectrum is virtually limitless (Level of Maturity). The horoscope does not reveal which of these possibilities an individual will experience. The less actively involved a person is in shaping their own life, the easier it is to predict the way in which a particular energy is likely to become manifest. This helps to explain why astrologers were able to make fairly accurate predictions in, for example, the Middle Ages when rigid social structures meant that there was less leeway for personal development in many areas of life. Today individuals are generally able to make more choices about their lives and have more opportunities to go in new directions: For example, it has become increasingly uncommon for a person to stay in the same job till they retire.

An increasing number of astrologers agree that the purpose and aim of predictive methods is to help individuals to become aware of the timing of likely developments and processes and to offer advice on finding the most creative and constructive ways of coping with these.

The more an astrologer is able to make a client aware of what possibilities are open, the more able the latter will be to take responsibility for their own actions. On the other hand, the more an astrologer stresses the unavoidability of fate - whether positive or negative - the more likely it will be that a person takes a passive stance.

A deeper understanding of the processes involved can only be achieved by using descriptions which are as neutral as possible. For example, a possible description of Saturn transiting the Sun might be: The core / centre of the personality (Sun) goes through a process of concentrating on what is essential (Saturn in transit). So much is clear. What is not clear is whether this will manifest as a particular experience. It is also not possible to say if the individual concerned will suffer because of any possible restrictions or experience this as a time in which they can harvest the fruits of their labour.

This is only one of the reasons why an increasing number of astrologers reject the idea of event predictions because there is a danger that they will become self-fulfilling prophecies.

Triggers show inner developments but are not their causes. Psychological Astrology believes that if an individual remains unaware of inner developments they attract external events which force them to confront these. However, it should be remembered that every individual is occasionally confronted with an event whose significance goes beyond their own personality - after all they are part of a community or society. It is quite possible for certain triggers to reflect this fact. As with triggers of a more personal nature, they do not predict concrete events but indicate how a person will react to them and what significance they are likely to attach to them. Predictive Astrology

Johannes Kepler's first chart for Wallenstein[1]
In the past, the most common form of astrology. Predictive astrology tries to forecast events and trends on the basis of observable changes in the positions of planets and sensitive points over time.

Many modern psychological astrologers reject (at least in theory) the detailed prediction of events as a form of fortune-telling and determinism. Instead they highlight developing themes and trends in people's lives in more general ways, so that individuals can make the best of upcoming situations by finding creative and constructive solutions.

In the view of the Munich Rhythm Method every event is repeated: sooner or later...
There are many methods of astrological prediction. The most important ones are:

Lunar return charts
Primary directions
Secondary progressions
Solar arcs
Solar return charts
Tertiary progressions
Transits
It is not possible to make a direct comparison of the various methods to see which one is better or worse. Every astrologer will have his or her own particular approach to each method, leading to different types of explanations.

The methods are inherently different because they not only deal with different uses of planets and sensitive points but also with different periods of time. For example, a transit shows the actual movement of planets over time in relation to a natal or event chart. A secondary progression moves the planets within the natal chart according to the formula of a year in the individual's life set equal to one day of planetary movement according to an ephemeris.

To find out which themes are likely to occur at any particular moment, it is advisable to combine two or three different methods covering similar periods of time. A comparison can then show if certain themes are consistently highlighted. A study of the transits alone makes it clear how many triggers are active in any given period of time. Consequently astrologers concentrate on certain issues to avoid for the sake of clarity. Transits are the most common and simplest predictive method used, followed by secondary progressions and solar arcs.

For longer periods of time astrologers rely on predictive methods which indicate long-term developments, such as transits of the slow moving planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto; whose influence can last from a few months to several years. In contrast, the most commonly used secondary progressions for long term predictions are those of the sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars which last from six months to a year. The outer planets, because they move so slowly, will normally show little change in a secondary progression chart until the native is at least in late middle age. The solar return chart is valid for one year. For more detail one can include the secondary progressions of the Moon, tertiary progressions, lunar return charts and the transits of the faster moving planets, i.e. Sun, Mercury, Venus and Mars.

One recommended way of getting a better feel for how the future might look under a given upcoming transit is to study transits retroactively to see how a person reacted or what events arose during the same or similar transits in the past. Prognostication
Jump to navigationJump to search
Prognostication means predicting the future, from the Latin root for "fore knowledge." It has the same root as the medical term prognosis, meaning the expected outcome for a patient's health.

Prognostication is the term sometimes used in English translations of the Bible to condemn soothsayers and diviners who predict the future - presumably including predictive astrologers (Isaiah 47: 12-13) The Bible, however, does not condemn astrology as a method of character analysis Progression

Progressions (and directions) usually are based on the sun's motion
A term for a particular kind of predictive method which takes a defined period of time after the birth as symbolically equating with a different, much longer period of time in the person's life. The method uses actual planetary movement and should not be confused with predictive methods which use directions.

5	Bibliography
Methods
The various predictive methods use different symbolic periods of time as equivalents for the actual passage of time. The different keys are:

Secondary progressions (Each day after the birth date is equivalent to one year.)
Tertiary progressions 1 (Each day after the date of birth is equivalent to one month.)
Tertiary progressions 2 (Each month after the date of birth is equivalent to one year.)
Converse Progressions (Different calculations, depending on the method used.)
Interpretation
More details on the way each method differs from the others can be found under the separate entries. Although there are no rigid distinctions between progressions and transits in chart interpretation, progressions show changes intrinsic to a given horoscope but are abstract or conceptual in the sense that a year of one's life does not literally equal one day. Transits show the actual movement of planets in the heavens at any particular time and are external to a given horoscope. Progressions therefore should indicate how a person evolves or matures, whereas transits indicate more of the external events likely to affect her. In practice these distinctions are hard to sustain, however, because some people experience transits as internal matters (such as a time of optimism or depression,) and progressions can synchronize with external events. For example, the progressed moon in the second House may indicate a time of an unexpected financial windfall or difficulty.

Axes
It is only possible to work with secondary progressive axes (which can be calculated using different methods) if the time of birth is exact, otherwise the inaccuracies are so great that any prediction becomes meaningless.

A predictive method which analyses a single day using the following method: A horoscope is erected for the time and place of birth but the date is changed to that of the desired date. Event Prediction
Jump to navigationJump to search
A form of prediction which attempts to predict concrete events, including the time of death. Event prognoses used to be widespread and, usually in accordance with the wishes of clients, are mostly concerned with tangible events such as the onset of an illness, the meeting of a partner or when an upturn in events can be expected. Many astrologers try to fulfill their clients' wishes, even though a growing number feel that the complexity of life makes such concrete prognoses impossible.

The inherent danger in this kind of astrological prognosis is that it may end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy and it can weaken a client's ability to exercise his free will, thus absolving him of any responsibility. Secondary Progression
Jump to navigationJump to search

Secondary progressions are based on the sun's motion
A Predictive Method in which each day after birth equates to one year in a person's life, in keeping with the sun moving one degree per day. The other planets are moved in proportion, according to where they would be in an ephemeris. The positions of the planets 24 hours after the birth reflect the quality of an individual's life at one year old, 48 hours at two years old, etc. Secondary progressions are a very commonly used predictive method. It is the method usually meant when talking of progressions.

In contrast to the two kinds of Tertiary Progressions, which are based on the moon's movement, secondary progressions are based on the sun: one day (i.e., one complete rotation of the earth around its own axis) equates to one year (the time it takes for the sun to apparently move through the whole zodiac). Because secondary progressions are concerned with much larger periods of time than tertiary progressions they are related to long term inner developments.

Interpretation
Interpretation of secondary progressions usually focuses on the Personal Planets, i.e. the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars, because the remaining planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) progress so little during a younger person's life and rarely function as Triggers because they hardly change position. In an older person's chart they can become more relevant, especially if located near the end of a sign or house, as a few degrees' change can move them into the next sign or house.

There are two ways to construct a chart for secondary progressions. One is to make a bi-wheel with progressed planets arrayed in relation to the natal or Radix Chart. This chart preserves the basic house structure of the natal chart. Another way is to cast the progressed chart on its own, which will also progress the house cusps.

Points to consider in interpreting a progressed chart:

An aspect formed by a progressed planet to a planet or Axis in the natal chart indicates a flow of energy and activation of the factors involved. The main focus is on the natal planet or axis which is aspected.
A mutual exchange of energy occurs when two progressed planets aspect each other.
A progressed planet entering a new house or sign indicates a major shift in the person's orientation to life.
The progressed moon activates the house in the natal chart through which it passes. For example, the person may focus on money when her progressed moon is in the second house.
A progressed planet may change its direction of movement, i.e. from direct to retrograde and vice versa. For example, a person with natal Mercury retrograde may become less introspective and more outer-directed when progressed Mercury goes direct.
In general, progressions show how the individual is evolving and maturing as a person. If an Aries sun progresses into Taurus, for example, the person retains his basic Aries independence, but may add to it some Taurean stability and material orientation. A person with a natal fourth house moon retains her strong feelings about her home, but may add to it a preoccupation with health when the moon progresses into the sixth house. The horoscope at the moment of the child's birth may be compared to a seed, while progressions show how the plant is growing.

Periods of time
The sun moves about one degree per day, which translates into the progressed sun moving one degree of arc for each year. Venus, on average, moves around 1.5 degrees, and Mars 0.5 degrees per day, and therefore for each year by progression. Only Mercury is quicker than the Sun and moves around 2 degrees per day.

The Orb, which is the number of degrees that an aspect can deviate from exactitude and still be regarded as valid, used for progressed planets is small (around half a degree) owing to their slow movement. The reason is because even an orb of half a degree is equivalent to a period of around six to twelve months. There will naturally be a focus on the theme indicated by the involved planets when the aspect is exact.

The moon, which is the fastest-moving planet, is an exception. It travels around one degree of arc for every month. For this reason, the progressed moon frequently forms new aspects to planets in the natal chart. It spends on average 2 1/2 years in one house or sign of the zodiac and activates this area of the horoscope during that period. An orb of around one degree can be used with the progressive Moon, which affects a period of about 2 months in real life.

Aspects
It is important not to place too much emphasis on the type of aspect formed by the progressed sun, Mercury, Venus or Mars, whether easy or difficult for the person. Which planets are involved (and the themes they represent) is most important because new major aspects are relatively rare. For example, when the progressed sun forms a Square (90 degree aspect) to a planet in the natal chart, it takes another 30 years until the sun forms the next main aspect (the Trine which is 120 degrees) to the same planet.

Axes
The progressed axes are a special case. A Time of Birth accurate to within a minute is required in order to be able to include these in a meaningful way, otherwise any Predictions will be wide off the mark by at least one year. Several methods can be used if an accurate time of birth is available.

The most common method for calculating progressed axes and houses uses the so-called Naibod key. This is the daily progression of sidereal time, as listed in the ephemeris. It is 3m 56.55s, derived from the mean daily motion of the Sun of 0.98564733 degrees. The sidereal time of birth is increased by this amount for each year of life. The progressive sidereal time thus obtained is used to calculate the progressed axes and houses.

Another popular method is to advance the Medium Coeli by the same amount as the progressed sun, i.e.,, the Solar Arc method. In this case, the angle between the sun and the MC in the progressed chart stays the same as in the natal chart. The Ascendant and other house cusps are moved in accordance with the MC. Solar Return Chart

Once a year the Sun reaches its position at the time of birth[1]
A return chart, or to be more precise: A chart erected for the exact moment when the Sun returns to its position in the natal chart. This occurs either on the same date as the day of birth or the day before or after.

The solar return chart indicates what themes will be important over the coming year and it is one of the longest standing astrological methods of prediction. The themes in the solar chart can usually be felt one or two months before a person's birthday.

Calculation
The solar return chart is calculated on the basis of the Sun's exact position in the natal chart. A chart is erected for the time and place an individual happens to be when the transiting Sun reaches this degree.

The Sun is not the only "planet" for which it is possible to erect a return chart - this can also be done for the other planets.

Location
Three possible locations can be chosen for the solar return chart - either an individual's present place of residence, their place of birth or the place at which they happen to be is at this point in time. Much could be said for choosing a person's place of residence because that is where they are likely to spend most of the coming year, but the place of birth also has its claim to legitimacy. However, some astrologers prefer to use a person's actual location at the time of the solar return. If this location is very far away from a person's present residence or place of birth, the axes and house cusps of the solar chart will be in very different positions.

Interpretation
An interpretation of the solar return chart only makes sense against the backdrop of the natal chart. It makes little sense to interpret it on its own. The following list includes the main criteria for interpretation:

The Solar Ascendant: It shows an individual's approach to life in general in the coming year
The Solar Medium Coeli: It shows the general aim in the coming year. These houses will be activated:
The natal houses in which the solar Ascendant and Medium Coeli fall
The natal house and the solar house in which the ruler of the solar Ascendant stands
The solar house in which the Sun stands
Any solar house with three or more solar planets in it
Planets which aspect the axes in the solar return chart - they are particularly significant if they are conjunct the Ascendant
Repetition of aspects: Aspects that occur in both the solar chart and the natal chart are particularly significant. When this happens the themes this aspect represents in the natal chart are emphasised and can find new forms of expression or impetus. For example, if there is a square between Saturn and the Sun in the natal chart and a trine between the same two planets in the solar return chart, the horoscope owner will probably find it easier to cope with Saturn/Sun themes in the coming year
Any planets in the natal chart which receive many aspects from solar planets will be activated in the coming year
It is not necessary to carry out such a detailed psychological interpretation of the solar return chart as is the case with the natal chart. It is possible to be far more concrete - although this doesn't mean prediction of events. The natal chart reveals the deeper motivations whereas the solar return chart is more concerned with current events.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you’ve got the core of predictive astrology laid out here. Let’s break this down so it’s easier to see the structure, purpose, and methods, and how they interrelate:

Prediction in Astrology
Prediction (Prognosis / Prognostication): Literally “fore-knowledge,” predicting possible outcomes based on natal chart energies.

Astrology is primarily about understanding human nature, not fortune-telling.

Predictive methods highlight themes, processes, and internal developments, rather than concrete events.

The more a person is actively shaping their life, the less deterministic predictions become. Predictions are probabilities, not certainties.

Key Principles
Triggers vs. Causes

Transits, progressions, and returns trigger energies already in the natal chart.

They don’t cause events, but indicate how the person might react or the areas of life likely to be activated.

Awareness over Determinism

Predictive astrology aims to increase self-awareness and help people make creative choices.

Focusing too much on “inevitability” risks self-fulfilling prophecies.

Internal vs. External

Progressions → internal evolution, personal growth, psychological shifts.

Transits → external events and how they impact the individual.

Often these overlap; internal growth can coincide with external events.

Common Predictive Methods
1. Transits
Track real-time movement of planets over the natal chart.

Show timing of themes, challenges, or opportunities.

Outer planets → long-term influences (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto).

Inner planets → shorter-term events and moods (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars).

2. Progressions
Secondary Progressions: 1 day after birth = 1 year of life (based on Sun’s motion).

Tracks personal evolution and maturing.

Focus on personal planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars).

Tertiary Progressions: Day = month or month = year, often tied to the Moon.

Interpretation Highlights:

Progressed planets aspecting natal planets = activation of themes.

Progressed planets changing sign or house = shifts in life focus.

Progressed Moon → emotional focus; ~2.5 years per house/sign.

3. Solar Return Charts
Chart for the exact moment the Sun returns to its natal position each year.

Reveals themes for the upcoming year.

Interpreted in context of the natal chart, not in isolation.

Key factors:

Solar Ascendant → approach to life in coming year.

Solar MC → general aims, career or life focus.

Houses activated by solar planets, aspects repeating natal aspects.

4. Other Methods
Lunar Returns → monthly emotional cycles.

Primary Directions → timing of life events.

Solar Arcs → similar to progressions, often applied to angles (Ascendant/MC).

Horary Astrology → answers based on chart of a specific question or moment.

General Rules of Predictive Astrology
Combine methods: e.g., transits + progressions + solar return for clarity.

Focus on patterns and themes: Look for repeated triggers to see the “likely focus areas” of the period.

Avoid rigid fate: Use predictive astrology as guidance, not a script.

Accuracy matters: Especially for progressed axes or solar arcs, precise birth time is crucial.

💡 Big Picture:
Predictive astrology is less about “this exact thing will happen” and more about timing of personal evolution. Think of it as a map of probabilities and potentials, showing where life energy is concentrated and which areas of personal growth or external challenge are highlighted.

If you want, I can make a visual chart showing the predictive methods, their time scales, and whether they reflect internal growth or external events, which makes it much easier to compare transits, progressions, and returns at a glance.

Do you want me to do that?

Mars Return Chart

Mars Return [1]
A horoscope erected for the exact moment that Mars returns to its position in the natal chart, i.e. at the moment of birth.
This occurs roughly every two years.


Contents
1	Interpretation
2	Method
3	See also
4	Notes and References
Interpretation
The Mars return horoscope indicates how and where a person is likely to be active in the coming two years.
In short: it is concerned with Mars themes.

Method
Due to its retrograde motion Mars sometimes passes over the same degree of the zodiac three times. Strictly speaking, should this occur at the same time as the Mars return, three different return horoscopes should be erected, although the usual recommendation is to erect a chart for the last time Mars passes over its natal position. It is senseless to erect a Mars return chart if the return occurs at a time when Mars is almost stationary, because its slow movement makes it impossible to accurately calculate the positions of the main axes and house cusps.

More information regarding calculation, location and interpretation can be found under the heading Solar Return Chart which is the horoscope erected for the time that the Sun conjuncts its own position in the natal chart, although it should not be forgotten that, whereas the solar return horoscope is valid for one year, the Mars return horoscope is valid for two years. The planet Mars is naturally the main focus of attention when interpreting the Mars return chart. For example, its house position is especially significant. However, a meaningful interpretation of the Mars return horoscope is only possible in relation to the natal chart. Mercury Return Chart

Theory
A horoscope erected for the moment that transiting Mercury is exactly conjunct the position of Mercury in the natal chart. This occurs once a year.

The Mercury return horoscope is concerned with the processes of learning and thinking during the period in question, i.e. all Mercurial themes. The Mercury return horoscope is one of several return charts.

Method
Retrograde motion sometimes causes Mercury to make a threefold passage over the same degree of the zodiac. When this occurs it would be, strictly speaking, necessary to erect three different horoscopes, but the general recommendation is to only erect a horoscope for the last of the three conjunctions. When the Mercury return happens during the phase in which Mercury is in its stationary phase and barely moving (just before moving retrograde or direct), the slow movement makes it virtually impossible to accurately calculate the positions of the main axes and other house cusps.

Interpretation
The same general rules used to calculate and interpret the solar return chart, which is valid for one year, also apply to the Mercury return chart - with the difference that in the latter chart Mercury is the planet of reference so the main focus of attention is on themes associated with that planet. For example, the house position of Mercury in the return horoscope will play a significant role. An interpretation of the Mercury Return Horoscope only makes sense against the backdrop of the natal chart. Tertiary Directions
Jump to navigationJump to search

Illustration of a life's clock by E.H. Troinski[1]
Synonym: Tertiary Direction

Tertiary progressions are a Predictive Method. There are two kinds of tertiary progressions: I (T I) and II (T II). In the first method, T I, each day after the day of birth is equivalent to one lunar month in an individual's life, and in the second method, T II, each synodic month after the day of birth is symbolically equivalent to one year in a person's life. Both methods are rarely used which doesn't, however, mean that they are of little value.

Tertiary methods of progression differ from some of the more commonly used secondary progressions in that they can also be applied to the slow moving planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, in addition to Jupiter which is relatively slow-moving.
With secondary progressions, these planets barely move and therefore hardly play a role in astrological interpretation.

The secondary progressions are related to the Sun's movement whereas tertiary progressions are based on the movement of the Moon.

6	Notes and References
Interpretation
The main factors in T I progressions are:

A new phase begins when a planet moves from one sign to the next.
Important triggers are stationary phases and eclipses which aspect planets and axes in the natal chart, also aspects (especially the conjunction, opposition or square) from (tertiary progressed) axes and planets to axes or planets in the natal chart.
The same factors also play a role in T II tertiary progressions, although it makes more sense to include - with the rather obvious exception of eclipses - the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, presuming short term triggers are not the main focus of attention.

Periods of Time
Both methods of Tertiary Progression are concerned with much smaller periods of time than secondary progressions and are therefore useful for making detailed short-term predictions. With T I, the Sun moves roughly one degree per month which makes it equivalent to the secondary progressed Moon. It can also be used to measure the average diurnal movement of the other planets. With the T II method, the planets move at one twelfth of their actual speed: for example, the Moon moves around one degree instead of twelve and the Sun around 2 1/2 degrees in one month instead of around 30 degrees.

Axes
Various methods can be used to progress the horoscope axes. The simplest method is solar arcs which moves the Medium Coeli in line with the (tertiary) progressed Sun so that the angle between the Sun and the MC in the tertiary progressed chart always remains the same as the angle in the natal one. The movement of the other house cusps is based on the movement of the Medium Coeli.

Weblinks Transit
Jump to navigationJump to search

Astronomical transit of Venus across the face of the Sun[1]
A transit (literally: to pass through) occurs when an actual moving planet forms an aspect to a Horoscope Factor in the Natal Chart, i.e. to either a planet or an Axis (and even to Midpoint in a more detailed analysis). When the aspect becomes exact it is said to Trigger or activate the horoscope factor involved.

Transits are among the most important Predictive Methods in astrology. They are both a simple and powerful tool to help understand which themes will be active and dominant during a particular period of time. The way in which this happens is indicated by the transiting planet.

A transit is also said to occur when a planet simply moves through a particular house in the horoscope.

The transits of the Slow-moving Planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are considered to be more important than those of Jupiter and the Fast-moving Planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars). In principle the rule applies that the effect of a transit increases the slower the planet concerned is moving (Diurnal Movement). However, it makes little sense to compare the significance of the transits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto because they are all significant in their own way.

Period of validity
Because of their Retrograde Motion, Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter sometimes pass over the same degrees of the zodiac three times, Saturn does this frequently, Uranus, Neptune even more and Pluto passes over all the degrees of the zodiac at least three times - Neptune and Pluto can even pass over some degrees of the zodiac up to five times. This is called a threefold or fivefold transit and can considerably extend the length of time for which a transit is valid. In the case of Jupiter this can range from several weeks to months, with Saturn up to one year and with Uranus, Neptune and Pluto up to two or three years. Mercury, Venus and Mars transits are considered to be more significant if they occur during a phase of retrograde motion and pass three times over the same degree of the zodiac. The effects from transits of the Moon and the Sun last, if they are felt at all, for either a few hours or one to two days.

Transits from Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto often indicate life-changing events or processes.

When a planet transits a house, the most important times are when it transits the House Cusps at the beginning and end of the house because these are the times at which the essence of the transit is apparent.

Orb
It is not possible to give a definite answer to the question of how much an aspect can diverge from exact and still be considered valid, in other words, how large the Orb should be. Sensitive individuals who are receptive to subtle energies and who tend to be self-reflective are likely to feel the transits of the slower moving planets long before the aspect becomes exact and will also be receptive to the daily changes and nuances caused by the transits of the faster moving planets. The transits of the faster moving planets are more important in the lives of children because children have a different perception of shorter periods of time than adults - with increasing age time appears to pass more quickly (Astrology of Children).

The initial recommendation is to use a small orb of around one degree, meaning that a transit is considered valid as long as it is within one degree of exactitude. The orb can then be increased to three or five degrees and observations made for this period to see if the effects of the transit are still felt. In any event the effects of a transit are usually stronger leading up to the moment at which it becomes exact and begin to weaken fairly quickly after this point.

The Stationary Phases are considered to be very significant. A planet is stationary for a while after changing from direct to retrograde motion and vice versa. An aspect formed during this stationary phase is thought to be very powerful.

Aspects
It is common practice to concentrate on the main aspects - the Conjunction, Sextile, Square, Trine and Opposition - but it is certainly no mistake to consider the so-called minor aspects, at least in the case of the slow-moving planets. The conjunction, formed when a transiting planet is at the same degree of the zodiac as a planet in the natal chart, is generally the most important. The next most important aspects are the square and the opposition, the so-called disharmonious or Analytical Aspects and finally the Sextile and Trine, or so-called Harmonious Aspects. However, the distinction makes less sense when dealing with the transits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, although it is possible that the the so-called harmonious aspects make it easier to deal with the changes they herald.

Trigger
The long-lasting nature of transits from the slower planets means that other Triggers play an important role during this period. It might be a New or Full Moon conjunct an important degree. The influence of an Eclipse that effects one or more chart factors will be greatly increased. Another possible trigger would be the transit to the degree in question by one of the faster moving planets; especially Mars, because it is an activating instigating principle. Another possible trigger is a planet transiting the natal position of the slow-moving transit planet.

Recurrence Transit[2]
A recurrence transit occurs when two planets which held a certain relationship relative to each other in a chart repeat the exact same alignment again at some point in the future by transit.

For example, if a person was born when Jupiter was exactly 52 degrees from Saturn in the zodiac, then they would have a recurrence transit at some point in the future when Jupiter was again exactly 52 degrees away from Saturn in the zodiac.

In order for it to be a true recurrence transit the two planets must share the exact same phase relationship with each other, so that it is not just a repetition of the distances involved between the two planets, but it is also a repetition of their relationship relative to each other as well. That is to say, if Jupiter was 52 degrees from Saturn in the natal chart in the waxing phase of the relationship, then this would be different than if Jupiter was 52 degrees from Saturn in the waning phase of the relationship. Both the distances and the phase relationship involved must be the same for it to be considered a recurrence transit.

Interpretation
It is important to find out which role the transiting planet plays in the natal chart, i.e. its position by house and sign and the aspects it forms to other horoscope factors. This is the background energy against which the individual concerned will experience the transit. The ten planets in transit have the following effects:

Transits of the Sun increase the conscious awareness of a certain issue
Transits of the Moon describe emotional atmospheres or moods
Transits of Mercury indicate intellectual understanding, communication, and short-distance travel
Transits of Venus relate to sensual perceptions, relationships, and fine arts
Transits of Mars can energize and activate the area of life in question, but also incidate times to watch against quarrels and accidents
Transits of Jupiter stand for periods of growth in the search for meaning in the area of life in question
Transits of Saturn stand for phases when an individual matures and concentrates on what is essential in the area of life in question; but can be times of limitation, disappointment, or increased responsibility
Transits of Uranus ideally are revolutionary and liberating, but unexpected and unwanted turns of events can also be the cause of great anxiety for people who fear change
Transits of Neptune increase sensitivity but can also create disappointment, disillusionment and dissolution
Transits of Pluto destroy existing structures that have become outdated and can lead to healing and transformational processes that give us a greater sense of personal wholeness Venus Return Chart
Jump to navigationJump to search
The Venus return chart is the chart drawn for the exact time when transiting Venus conjuncts Venus in the natal chart. This occurs once a year. The Venus return chart indicates an individual's attitude to relationships and pleasure during the period in question - in other words, themes associated with the planet Venus. It is one of the various Return Charts.

Venus can pass over some degrees of the zodiac three times due to its retrograde motion. Theoretically three charts should be drawn for the Venus return horoscope when this occurs at the same degree of Venus in the natal chart, although the usual recommendation in practice is to erect a chart for the last time that transiting Venus passes over its natal chart position.

A Venus return chart is virtually impossible to calculate when it occurs during the planet's stationary phase. Because it is moving so slowly (or not at all) that it is not possible to accurately calculate the position of the Ascendant and therefore the other house cusps.

The same general rules concerning calculation, place and interpretation of the Solar Return Chart also apply to the Venus return chart - the obvious difference being that in this case Venus, and not the Sun, is the focus of attention. For instance, the house position of Venus in the return chart is significant. A meaningful interpretation of Venus return horoscopes is only possible against the backdrop of the natal chart. The Yin quality of the Venus return chart means that, like the lunar return chart, its influence tends to be more subtle in nature - in contrast to the charts of the Sun and Mars where the quality of yang is dominant (Mars Return Chart).

General
A branch of astrology concerned with the relationship between the horoscope and the physical body, particularly its relationship to illness and dispositions, but also with regard to its potential to reveal methods of healing. Medical astrology is based on the idea that the planets, signs, and houses are related to the organs and parts of the physical body. For example, Aries and the First House rule the head, and Pisces and the Twelfth House rule the feet. Neptune, because of its illusory nature, rules both drug addiction and illnesses that are difficult to diagnose.

The Sixth House indicates the person's state of health in a general way, and the first house represents the physical body. If someone suffers from backache, however, it is helpful to know that Leo rules the back and Saturn rules the bones, especially the spine.

Today modern psychological astrologers might try to work with a client to heal illnesses with a psychosomatic component, whereas others might recommend specific herbs or mineral supplements ruled by a particular planet to balance afflicted areas in the horoscope.

The practice of medical astrology requires profound medical knowledge, and is not a substitute for the care of a licensed medical doctor. In the hands of a skilled practitioner it may compliment the physician's care or provide some relief in cases that standard medical practices did not diagnose or heal.


1850 issue of Culpeper
Decumbiture Chart[1]
In astrology a decumbiture chart is an inception chart that is cast for the moment that a person lays down or takes to their bed as a result of becoming ill.

The decumbiture chart is essentially an inception or commencement chart for the illness itself, and it is used in medical astrology in order to determine information about the nature and course of the illness.

Before the advent of modern medicine, doctors and herbalists studied astrology as their principal diagnostic tool. Physician-astrologers would look at the patient's nativity but also cast a decumbiture chart: an event chart for the moment the patient took to bed. Today other useful event charts might be cast for the time of the onset of an illness or injury, as well as scheduling an optimum time for elective surgery.

The practice is apparently very old, dating back to the early Hellenistic tradition. It was especially used in late Medieval and Renaissance Europe when most doctors had some training in astrology, in order to help diagnose and treat patients.

The term is derived from the Latin word decumbo, which means “to lie down” or “to fall down”.

The use of this term by the Latin authors is probably in imitation of the use of the word kataklisis (κατάκλισις) to refer to the same concept in Greek astrological texts. Kataklisis also means “to lie down” or “take to one’s bed”. Physiological Equivalents

The nutrients (Mercury-Virgo) in the blood are used to nourish the cells (Venus-Taurus) and promote cell growth (Jupiter). The body is detoxified (Venus-Libra) and waste expunged (Pluto-Scorpio). The nervous (Mercury and Uranus) and lymphatic systems (moon-Cancer) permeate bodily tissue. ... The idea of associating individual organs and parts of the body with particular astrological principles is based on their specialised functions." House Six

Interpretation
The sixth house is related to health and work. Howard Sasportas explains the link between these two areas as follows: "The sixth house explores the relationship between an individual's inner life and the outer world - the world of thoughts and emotions and the outer one of form and physicality." Illness can be an expression of discord between these two areas. Every illness can be understood as a symbol which points to where the inner and outer are at odds with each other (Medical Astrology). The work routine (as opposed to a person's vocation which is symbolised by the Tenth House) is also an indicator of the extent to which the inner expectations are in harmony with the outer circumstances. And because the majority of people are forced to compromise, the sign on the cusp of the sixth house together with any planets in the sixth house indicate how an individual copes with the restrictions resulting from the existing structures.

In contrast to the Twelfth House, in which a person can feel they are part of the wider universe, the sixth house is concerned with the ability to adapt to concrete circumstances.

Finally, the sixth house is also the house of colleagues, employees and pets.

ChatGPT said:
You’ve shared a deep dive into several predictive and return chart techniques in astrology, along with medical astrology principles. Let me summarize and clarify some of the main points for easy digestion and practical use:

Return Charts
Return charts are erected for the moment a transiting planet returns to its natal position. Each return focuses on the themes of that planet:

Mars Return (every ~2 years): Shows how/where you’ll be active, your drive, assertiveness, and conflicts. It covers a two-year period. Key: house placement and aspects to natal planets.

Mercury Return (annually): Focuses on communication, learning, and thought processes. Highlights intellectual activities and mental clarity over the year.

Venus Return (annually): Deals with relationships, pleasure, aesthetic sense, and social harmony for the year.

Solar Return (annually): A more general overview of the year ahead, showing themes in life, focus, and challenges. The Sun’s house, aspects, and the solar Ascendant are particularly important.

⚡ Tip: Return charts are best interpreted against the natal chart backdrop, not in isolation.

Predictive Methods
Astrologers use several methods to track inner developments and external trends:

Transits: Actual planetary movement relative to natal planets. Slower planets (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) signal long-term, life-changing processes; faster planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars) signal shorter, more immediate influences.

Secondary Progressions: One day = one year. Focuses on inner growth and personal evolution. The Moon progresses fastest, activating areas of life over ~2.5 years per house.

Tertiary Progressions: Linked to the Moon. Short-term, detailed predictions; less commonly used.

Solar Arcs & Directions: Movement of the entire chart as a unit, used for timing major life events or phases.

Key principle: predictive astrology is less about “fate” and more about understanding when energies are likely to manifest, helping the individual act consciously rather than react unconsciously.

Medical Astrology
Connects planets, signs, and houses to parts of the body:

Sun: Heart/circulation

Moon: Stomach, breasts, fluids, mucous membranes

Mercury: Nervous system, spine, lungs

Venus: Kidneys, veins, skin

Mars: Muscles, blood, male sexual organs

Jupiter: Liver

Saturn: Bones, teeth, skeletal structure

Neptune: Pituitary, chronic or elusive conditions

Pluto: Reproductive organs, elimination systems

6th House: Health, daily work, routines, pets, co-workers. Discord between inner life and outer routines can manifest as illness or tension.

⚡ Modern use: often psychological/psychosomatic healing or herbal/mineral supplementation, but always complementary to licensed medical care.

Key Principles
Triggers vs. Events: Progressions and transits show internal development; they don’t directly cause events but influence the likelihood of certain themes manifesting.

Self-awareness vs. Fate: Astrology is a guide for conscious action. Over-predicting events can lead to self-fulfilling prophecies.

Sequence of Great Conjunctions from an earthly or astronomical perspective[1]

Saturn and Jupiter[2]
In astrology, this refers to the Conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, which occurs approximately every twenty years.

Details and History
Every third Great Conjunction is a Triple Conjunction, meaning: Jupiter first moves directly, then retrograde, and finally again forward past Saturn. This is given special significance; it is considered one of the explanatory models for the Star of Bethlehem.
Two consecutive Great Conjunctions always occur in Trine to each other, during an overall retrograde movement of the conjunctions through the zodiac. After about eight hundred years, the Cycle begins anew approximately at the same point in the Zodiac.
The method of this astrological historical perspective was developed in Sassanid (Hellenistic) Persia during late antiquity. It reached the Latin West through Arab astrologers like Alcabitius and Albumasar, where it became particularly popular during the Renaissance, notably with Gerolamo Cardano and Johannes Kepler.[3]


Sequence of Great Conjunctions according to Kepler[4]
Interpretation
Great Conjunctions are classically regarded as the King's Aspect (coniunctio aurea). They symbolically represent a union of the Spiritual (Jupiter) with the Temporal-Political (Saturn). According to Albumasar, they signify "Changes in parties and offices and in legislative changes..." They manifest "in the appearance of prophets and prophecies and wonders in parties and state offices."[5]
In the late Middle Ages, a Great Conjunction was often feared to bring great misfortune (see illustrations):


Albumasar on Great Conjunctions[6]
Great Conjunction of 1524
It was primarily Johannes Stöffler who announced the conjunction of 1524 as a terrifying event: In this year, neither a solar nor a lunar eclipse will be visible. However, in the current year, there will be extremely remarkable movements of the wandering stars. In the month of February, there will be 20 conjunctions, some of which will be of moderate nature, while others will be significant. 16 of them will be in watery signs. These natural events will signify a change, a upheaval for nearly the entire globe, for all zones, kingdoms, provinces, states, both for dignitaries and for the lower, uneducated people, for animals, fish, and for all living beings on earth, a change that has not been passed down to us through historians or ancestors for millennia. Therefore, Christian men, lift up your heads[7]. This statement (and possibly others) were interpreted to mean that a new flood was to be expected. In Berlin, the Elector, advised by his astrologer Johannes Carion, went with his court to the nearby Kreuzberg. Instead of a flood, however, a great drought occurred that year[8]

Johannes Virdung did express, also in response to Stöffler's writing, his opposition to the flood scenario (see Practica of 1522), but he introduced the "Antichrist" of the Apocalypse into the discussion, predicting uprisings and a weakening of the Christian faith. His writing was particularly used to stoke fears regarding the Reformation movement around Martin Luther. It is no surprise that it saw up to fifteen further editions in the following years. Metagnostically, the Peasants' Wars in the 1520s were indeed interpreted as a confirmation of Virdung's prediction, especially since he stated: "And the lowly people, of base lineage, will rise against the kings and the powerful, they will drive them out of their power and persecute them terribly" (quote from the Practica of 1522).

Flood fears for 1524: Warning of the Great Flood or Terrible Waters[1]
Weather forecasts were of existential importance in ancient societies for sowing and harvesting. In Egypt from the early dynastic period to the Middle Kingdom (before 2000 BC), the heliacal rising and astronomical position of Sirius served as the annual "herald of the Nile flood". In the 5th century BC, in Babylonian astrology, planetary movements were also used for weather prediction. In the 4th century BC, Aristotle wrote in his Meteorologica that comets and eclipses could cause weather catastrophes; he also considered (fixed) stars and constellations such as Orion important for weather conditions.[2] The books of the Arab astrologer Al Kindi in the 9th century on astrometeorology were influential for later authors in this field.[3]


Flood prediction by Johannes Carion for 1524
The historically most famous miscalculation of astrometeorologists was the prediction of a Great Flood for 1524.[4]

Even Johannes Kepler kept regular weather records for many years, linking climatic conditions especially to planetary aspects. He, for example, predicted the extremely cold winter in Austria of 1593.[5]

Partly based on astrology is also the so-called "Hundred-Year Calendar" from the 17th century.[6]

Arabic Parts
John Frawley recommends[7] the following Arabic Parts as helpful for weather:

General weather point (also wind): AC + Dispositor of Mercury – Mercury

Point of Fire and Heat: AC + Mars – Sun

Point of Clouds: AC + Saturn – Mars

Point of Rain: AC + Venus – Moon

Point of Cold: AC + Saturn – Mercury

Frawley stresses that both the position of the dispositor and the condition of the part itself are important.


Babylonian weather god[8]
Weather Forecasting (Technical Notes)
Astrological weather prediction mainly uses quarter charts; they provide a general overview for the year and cover the following three months. For weekly outlooks, the lunar phases are considered: New Moon, First Quarter, Full Moon, Last Quarter. Charts are calculated for the location in question.

Interpretation focuses primarily on the Fourth House, and also the First House. Among the Planets, the Sun is considered warm and dry, the Moon cool and moist, Mercury windy, Mars violent and extreme, Jupiter warm and pleasant, Saturn harsh and cold, etc.[9] Parallels (declination parallels) are also given special attention.

Jump to navigationJump to search

The nations' wheel of destiny[1]
Mundane astrology is the branch of astrology whose subjects are the events of geographical regions, places, countries and the whole world (as opposed to individual astrology).

The name derives from the Latin term mundus, 'world'.

Certain countries have astrological charts (or horoscopes) just like a person is said to in astrology; for example, the chart for the USA is widely thought to be sometime during the day of 4 July 1776, for this is the exact day that the Declaration of Independence was signed and made fully official, thus causing the "birth" of the United States of America as a nation. Indeed, July 4 is a major national holiday in America and unequivocally thought of as the "birthday" of the entire nation.

History
Mundane astrology is widely believed by astrological historians to be the most ancient branch of astrology. Early Babylonian astrology was exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented, specifically applied to countries, cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation. Astrological practices of divination and planetary interpretation have been used for millennia to answer political questions, but only with the gradual emergence of horoscopic astrology, from the sixth century BC, did astrology develop into the two distinct branches of mundane astrology and natal astrology.

The techiques of the subject were discussed in detail in the 2nd century work of the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, who outlined its principles in the second book of his Tetrabiblos. Ptolemy set this topic before his discussion of individual birth charts because he argued that the astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community. The third chapter of his work offers an association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:

1. Each of the fixed stars has familiarity with the countries attributed to the sign of its ecliptic rising.
2. The time of the first founding of a city (or nation) can be used in a similar way to an individual horoscope, to astrologically establish the characteristics and experiences of that city. The most significant considerations are the regions of the zodiac which mark the place of the Sun and Moon, and the four angles of the chart – in particular the ascendant.
3. If the time of the foundation of the city or nation is not known, a similar use can be made of the horoscope of whoever holds office or is king at the time, with particular attention given to the midheaven of that chart.

The first English astrologer for whom we have evidence of astrological practice is Richard Trewythian, whose notebook is largely concerned with mundane astrology. He constructed horoscopes for the Sun's ingress into Aries over thirty years, and recorded general predictions for twelve of those years between 1430 and 1458.[2]


The aspects, such as opposition, square, etc.[3]
Techniques and principles
There are different approaches to mundane astrology.
They include analysis, interpretation and prediction of political and economic developments, historical developments and natural or man-made disasters.

Several main factors are taken into account when considering mundane events:

Planetary cycles (including the lunar cycle and the Jupiter-Saturn cycle)
Eclipses
Ingresses (which occur when planets enter a new sign of the zodiac)
Astrocartography
A chart is usually drawn when considering events related to a group of people, such as companies, clubs, countries, and so on. For this to work there must be a specific event such as the signing of a treaty or some other document or a clearly defined ritual that marks the beginning of a new process. A horoscope is then drawn for this time.

A chart drawn to a country is a national chart. Countries usually have several horoscopes (for example for the signing of the constitution or the beginning of a legislative period) which together give a better reflection of a country's complexity than any single horoscope.

Event charts are also drawn when considering natural events (such as earthquakes, eruptions and so on) or man-made disasters (such as accidents, fires and so on).

Early astrology was strongly influenced by mundane astrology. Up until the time of antiquity, the individual was not considered to be especially important. He or she was part of the community which astrology was meant to serve. Even the horoscopes of high ranking individuals were only viewed as having legitimacy for their significance for the wider community. At this time astrology played an important social role. It was expected to be able to predict when dangers would occur and how they might be avoided. Military action without some kind of astrological consultation was almost unthinkable.

In the course of history, the individual became the focus of attention in the western world and this development has led to the general decline of mundane astrology; its influence on the development of society has almost completely disappeared. However, it continues to be practised in small specialist circles. Politicians who consult astrologers before making important political decisions (as was the case with Ronald Reagan) are usually treated with derision.

The importance of mundane astrology has continued in Asia. In India or China representatives of the state would be met with looks of incomprehension if they were to ignore astrological advice. Quarter Horoscope
Jump to navigationJump to search

The four quarters or seasons
Quarter horoscopes are calculated based on the solstice points (summer and winter solstice) or the equinoxes (spring and autumn equinox).
They are valid for a quarter of a year each.

The primary focus is on the Aries and Capricorn Ingress, which are sometimes considered effective for an entire year.

They are mainly used in Mundane Astrology and are often employed for political and economic Forecasts.

Of particular importance for Weather Astrology are the

Spring,
Summer,
Autumn, and
Winter horoscope.

The fall of the Berlin Wall.[1]
Astrologers who wish to understand particular events, be they major natural disasters, the signing of an important political document or minor episodes in the life of an individual person, use several techniques.

An event or Inception chart is cast for the time and place of a specific event, comparable to the birth chart of a person. When a chart is cast for the moment of a train wreck or a politically significant incident, the chart provides background information about the event and helps to better understand the dynamics involved.

In intepreting meaningful events in the life of a person, such as receiving a new job offer, it should always be compared with his birth chart.

Because a given event horoscope will often apply to a much larger region than the site of a particular natural or political event, some astrologers look at additional information, such as any planetary lines crossing over the location, recent eclipses, or inception charts for the location of the event, such as one based on the incorporation of a city.

Economy doesn't simply mean money[1]
An area of mundane astrology that deals with economic developments.

Jump to navigationJump to search

A childbirth and astrologers studying the stars[1]
Astrology for children is being taken more seriously than ever. Apparently an increasing number of parents feel that a horoscope can help them to better understand their child's inherent potential. At the same time critics, including many pedagogues, argue that this practice may end up arresting rather than supporting a child's development.

The astrology of children is very similar to astrology in general although it places emphasis on particular horoscope factors. The Moon is considered to be a more important factor than the Sun, although it must be emphasised that any kind of meaningful interpretation is only possible if the natal chart as a whole is taken into consideration. The characteristics of the Moon position are thought to have a powerful influence on children's behaviour: they react emotionally, spontaneously and apparently illogically. The energies associated with the Sun, which help the individual to take an active and creative role in shaping his/her own life, are thought to gradually come to the fore from about the the age of seven and then especially during puberty.

The continuous waxing and waning of the Moon is also thought to be reflected in the openness to change and unpredictability often associated with children. It would certainly seem to be the case that as humans age they find it increasingly more difficult to remain flexible, spontaneous and able to adapt to change. This is true both mentally and physically. A child is in a continuous state of change which is reflected in the process of physical growth. A great variety of behaviour is of course possible, depending on the Moon's sign and aspects. There are also analogies in the symbolism of receiving and giving, two basic lunar qualities. With their limited life experience, children are more dependent on receiving impressions and impulses in order to grow and find their way in life. The ability to receive requires an openness which is reflected by the Moon in it's crescent phase that is also the symbol for the Moon in astrology.

The Descending Moon's Node is also a significant and revealing factor in a child's horoscope, as is the Imum Coeli and the Fourth House.

Astrologers believe that the newly born child already possesses innate characteristics and to a certain extent a life plan that strives towards active realisation. In an astrological consultation it is important to tread very carefully because children (particularly younger children) are often not present - and if they are present may find it difficult to argue against what they may feel to be inappropriate interpretations. An astrologer needs to proceed with great sensitivity in order to avoid using descriptions that are narrow and predetermined.

Astrology for children can potentially provide valuable help when it comes to raising a child. If a child is often unusually aggressive or hyperactive, or strangely silent and uncommunicative, the horoscope can be a help in finding the possible underlying cause. However, it is important not to remain at the level of recognising a problem and coming out with a statement such as "Aha, Mars in Aries means he just can't help himself". Modern astrology doesn't simply describe a static state but aims to help children (and adults!) to find creative ways of using their existent energies. The horoscope can reveal chances, potential and possible pitfalls for every child, and not only those who exhibit so-called behavioural difficulties. An early awareness of unique personality traits can promote tolerance and can help parents and those who work with children to avoid some of the more common conflicts and problems that often arise. Natal Astrology

The twelve astrological houses in an Icelandic manuscript[1]
The original (Greek) term is Genethlialogia (γενεθλιαλογία), which means “the study that pertains to nativities” or “the study that pertains to births”.[2]

The area of astrology concerned with interpreting the natal chart as a means of describing the individual's personality, experiences, and possibly future events.

This is now the most frequently practised and probably most important form of astrology, although in the past this was not necessarily the case because most people did not know their birth times.

Natal astrology is separate from other forms and methods of astrology based on events, such as mundane, horary, and electional astrology. Partner Comparison
Jump to navigationJump to search

Before Marriage: Love is Amor's job[1]
Questions concerning the essence of a relationship are among the most important reasons for people to consult astrologers. In this field there are two basic approaches.

In Comparative Astrology, several different methods are used to compare two horoscopes, including Synastry, Davison Relationship Chart and midpoint composite charts. The composite and Davison charts indicate how two people function as a couple, rather than as two separate individuals.
Astrologers also examine the theme of relationships within a single horoscope. Several horoscope factors reveal an individual's partner image, the most well known of these being the Descendant. It indicates a person's innate ideals, expectations and hopes concerning relationships. Which energies a person invests in and seeks in relationships is shown by the zodiac sign on the descendant, the planetary Ruler of the Sign on the seventh house cusp, and any planets located in the Seventh House.
The concept of Anima/Animus is also significant for an individual's partner image. It reveals what kind of archetypal images are present in an individual's psyche concerning members of the same or the opposite sex, which may be expressed in an instinctive and unreflective way. The position of the Moon and Venus in a man's chart reveal his inner image of women, while in a woman's chart, the position of the Sun and Mars indicate her inner image of men.

This is not to say that a woman with Pisces on the cusp of her seventh house and Mars in Pisces will be attracted only to sun-sign Pisces men. Rather, the sign's qualities of sensitivity and acceptance will be important to her. Comparative Astrology
Jump to navigationJump to search

The sign of Libra[1]
Comparative astrology analyses the relationship between two or more horoscopes. It usually involves the natal charts of two people, but in theory any charts that mark a birth, event, or initiation of a process can be compared to each other.

Birth chart comparison for two people involved in an intimate relationship is the most common type. However, the comparison of any two natal charts - such as those of parents and children, work colleagues or employees and their supervisors - can throw light on the underlying dynamics of a relationship. Multiple charts might be interpreted for a family. A comparison of different natal charts can reveal a great deal about the character of a relationship: its potentials, possibilities and dangers.

The astrologer might also compare event charts, such as of a nation's founding date and a natural disaster; a Horary Chart with a client's natal chart; or a worker's natal chart with the moment of a new job offer. In proposing an electional chart for a client's new business, an astrologer would compare it with her natal chart.

Comparative astrology generally makes use of one of three methods:

Synastry, in which two charts are compared side-by-side or are overlaid.
Midpoint composite charts, which show the midpoints of planets and sensitive points between the two charts.
Davison relationship charts, based on the mean values of the birth locations and birth dates Composite Chart

Synonym: Midpoint composite chart

A chart based on the combined birth data of two people – not to be confused with a Davison Relationship Chart. As with the latter, computers ease the task of calculating the horoscope and discerning the main themes of the relationship.

Calculation
Midpoints are calculated based on taking the two natal charts of the people involved and halving the total sums – based on the smallest angle between them. For example, if one partner has the Moon at 13 degrees Taurus and the other at 27 degrees Aquarius, then the smallest angle between the two is 76 degrees. The composite Moon is located at the midpoint of 5 degrees Aries. The same method is used to calculate the position of all the other planets, the Moon's Nodes, and the MC and Asc. The house cusps can be taken from a table of houses based on the positions of the composite MC and Asc positions already calculated; a task simplified today by computer programs. An alternative way to calculate the Ascendant is to take the median time of birth at the place of birth – a method which can only be applied if the individuals were born at the same place.

Interpretation
The midpoint composite chart, like the Davison Relationship Chart, is a conceptual or abstract chart. Composite midpoints can give planetary positions that would be impossible in reality. For example, it is possible for composite Mercury to stand in opposition to the sun although these two planets in reality can never be separated by more than 28 degrees (see elongation.) Nevertheless, many astrologers believe that composite charts have interpretive value and that transits to composite planets will affect the relationship. The Davison chart, in contrast, is based upon averaging actual times and geographical positions, thus giving a more realistic picture of the heavens, but it can locate the relationship in a geographically unlikely place, such as on the high seas or in the midst of a polar ice cap.

Astrologers disagree on the merit of one type of chart over the other. Critics of the composite chart suggest that it reveals the energy present at the start of a relationship whereas the Davison chart shows the deeper aspects of the relationship. The German astrologer Mona Riegger argues that "the composite chart equates to seventh house themes, whereas the Davison Relationship chart is more a reflection of the eighth house. The composite describes the phase of discovery and the Davison Relationship chart that of stabilisation." And further: "A composite horoscope can give us insights into many different kinds of human interaction, whereas I would only use a Davison Relationship chart when looking at relationships in which there is a deeper sense of commitment."[1]

The midpoint composite chart, or simple Synastry comparisons, however, are favored in the writings of prominent American astrologers.

The composite chart is read as the chart of a couple (or other type of relationship, perhaps of a parent and child or employee and employer.) The sun by its house and sign indicates the purpose or identity of the relationship. The ascendant shows how the pair appear to the outside world. Harmonious aspects indicate areas of the relationship that are likely to flow smoothly; whereas disharmonious aspects can show trouble spots and tensions. Davison Relationship Chart

The Lovers (Rider-Waite Tarot deck.)
‎

A horoscope calculated by combining the birth data of two or more individuals, versus a composite chart calculated by determining the midpoints between planetary pairs in two or more horoscopes. The Davison relationship chart was named for Ronald C. Davison (1914-1985), author and president of the Astrological Lodge of the Theosophical Society of London.[1] Both Davison relationship charts (DRC) and composite horoscopes can help to assess the main themes within a relationship.

In German speaking countries this horoscope is called Kombin or Combin, with the Austrian astrologer Philip Schiffmann considered as one of its inventors.

Calculation
The date and time can be determined by calculating the day that lies exactly between the natal charts of those involved. The same principle is also applied to the times of birth.

If the individuals involved have different places of birth a combined "place of birth" is calculated by taking the average values of latitude and longitude. The longitude and latitude midpoints are taken separately. It is not customary to use the grand circle midpoint, as this often lands in arctic regions where no good charts can be made for intercontinental relationships.

The calculations for erecting a DRC for more than two people is a more complicated procedure, usually relying on a computer program.

Interpretation
Even if the combined place of birth is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the DRC is still a concrete horoscope for a specific time, place, and location which can, like any natal chart, be used as a basis to calculate solar return charts, progressions and the effect of transits. According to Mona Riegger it "can help to reveal the main theme which brought two people together, the kinds of experiences they will have, and which areas of life will be most affected."[2] She argues that the DRC can unlock the door to the deeper mysteries of a relationship in a way that other methods such as synastry are not able to do.

The Davison relationship horoscope is considered using the usual criteria for interpretation. The DRC initially describes the partnership as a whole. But it can also reveal aspects of the individuals involved when the ascendant is taken as representing the older partner; and the descendant the younger one, which is at the same time his or her ascendant. In the same way the Medium Coeli and Imum Coeli are reversed, with the MC of the older partner representing the IC of the younger one.

ChatGPT said:
Wow, you basically dumped an entire crash course in astrology in one go! Let me break down what’s happening here because there’s a lot to unpack, and I want to give you the clearest picture without it turning into a headache.

1. Great Conjunction (Jupiter + Saturn)
Happens roughly every 20 years.

Every third one is a Triple Conjunction (Jupiter moves direct → retrograde → direct past Saturn).

Historically, these were big deals—often linked to political changes, kings, prophecies, and sometimes feared as omens (like the Great Flood scare of 1524).

Astrologically, Jupiter = Spiritual / Expansion, Saturn = Temporal / Authority, so their alignment = a union of spiritual and worldly forces.

2. Astrometeorology (Weather Astrology)
Early humans used astrology to predict floods, droughts, and seasons.

Egyptians used Sirius rising for the Nile flood; Babylonians linked planetary positions to climate; Aristotle even thought eclipses affected weather.

Key planets:

Sun = warm/dry

Moon = cool/moist

Mercury = wind

Mars = extreme/violent

Jupiter = pleasant

Saturn = harsh/cold

Quarter horoscopes often predicted weather for seasons.

3. Mundane Astrology
Astrology for countries, cities, and major events rather than individuals.

Examples:

USA = birth chart on July 4, 1776

City foundations = chart at time of treaty or inauguration

Ptolemy emphasized: general tendencies of nations before individual fate.

Techniques include: planetary cycles, eclipses, ingresses, and astrocartography.

4. Event & Economic Astrology
Event astrology: Charts for specific events (natural disasters, political acts, openings of businesses, etc.).

Economic astrology: Observes planetary cycles in relation to currency, markets, or national wealth trends.

5. Astrology for Children
Moon is more important than Sun for temperament.

Moon’s phases = adaptability & receptivity.

Astrologers can track early inclinations, potential conflicts, and energy expression.

6. Relationship Astrology
Synastry = comparing 2 natal charts side-by-side.

Composite Chart = midpoint between two charts; shows relationship energy itself.

Davison Relationship Chart (DRC) = averages birth data and gives a realistic location/time chart.

Use for: couples, parent/child, employer/employee, event relationships.

Meta Summary
Astrology historically started as a collective tool (weather, politics, nations), then shifted to personal (natal charts, relationships).

Great Conjunctions were viewed as historical and spiritual milestones.

Astrometeorology and mundane astrology are examples of astrology’s practical application in societies.

Modern astrology often focuses more on individual potential, but older systems were community- or event-focused.

If you want, I can map out how the Great Conjunction cycles actually influence mundane events, like 1524, and draw parallels to modern 2020–2040 cycles, which would be insane because it’s basically cosmic predictive sociology.

Do you want me to do that?

A "synastry" is not just for lovers, though
‎Synastry is a method of comparing two or more horoscopes This makes it possible to find the Interaspects, i.e. the aspects between the planets and an Axis of one horoscope to another one. The method also shows where the planets in one horoscope fall in the other one and vice versa. Synastry can be used to compare many kinds of relationships, such as those between politicians and the state, stock shares and speculators, business partners, work colleagues, or parent and child. Synastry is most frequently used for romantic relationships. It is an effective and easily understood method, and it can be combined with Predictive Methods such as Transits. It is also used to compare the relationship between a single individual's Natal Chart and the Solar Return Chart.

Methods
Horoscopes can be compared with each other by plotting the planets of one horoscope in a bi-wheel (or tri-wheel, etc.) around another other, or planets and cusps from one chart may be simply plotted within another chart. Astrologers will also simply place two charts side by side.

Guidelines of Interpretation
The more aspects there are between two charts the greater the flow of energy between them. Few aspects indicate little exchange of energy between the two. So-called Disharmonious Aspects can hinder the flow of energy and create tensions, but they can also indicate a great potential for personal development for both partners. They represent points of friction that can force the individuals to invest energy into making the relationship work. The so-called Harmonious Aspects indicate that those involved find it easier to inspire one another, although the lack of friction can also make the relationship somewhat lethargic.

Several planets or an axis from partner A's horoscope in a particular house in the chart of partner B will emphasise these themes for the latter.

Aspects between the personal planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars) or Social Planets (Jupiter and Saturn) of one partner and the outer or Spiritual Planets (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) of the other often have a compelling quality that those involved find difficult to explain. They point towards the deeper dimensions of the relationship which further the personal growth of each individual.[1]

Personal growth frequently involves difficult themes which means that it is often marked by periods of crises. Such processes become easier to understand when those involved become more aware of the underlying potential and challenges in the relationship and less inclined to view it as vehicle to promote their personal ego-oriented wishes. If both partners are prepared to work on their relationship, contacts from the outer planets can offer tools for personal growth.

Aspects between the Saturn of one partner and the personal planets of the other may be difficult but also tend to lend the relationship more stability and security which makes them valuable for any long-term relationships.

It is important to interpret and understand each individual's horoscope as a single entity before trying to interpret the synastry between them. The level of maturity, which no horoscope can reveal, is highly significant, too. House Ten

Interpretation
The tenth house cusp is also the Medium Coeli which symbolises profession and life goal. The tenth house stands for how an individual is perceived in public and for his/ her role in society. This house is concerned with an individual's responsibilities, achievements and social recognition. The profession is an important aspect of what a person represents to society at large and is therefore associated with this house.

The zodiac sign on the Medium Coeli and any planets in the tenth house point to the kind of vocation a person will aim for.
The tenth house shows the fruits of labour as opposed to the fourth house which symbolises our roots.

Traditionally, the father has been associated with the tenth house and the mother with the fourth house - but today this classification often is reversed[1 House Eleven

Interpretation
The eleventh house stands for friends and groups. It is concerned with coming together with those sharing similar ideals and working toward common goals. Clubs, lobby groups and political parties are expressions of this house. In a more general sense, the eleventh house encompasses the wider community and ultimately all human beings, so that the eleventh house also represents the greater ideas intended to further humankind.
In contrast to the Fifth House and its emphasis on individual development, the eleventh house describes the commitment to broader ideas which have an impact in the wider society. The sign on the house cusp, together with any planets located there, indicate how an individual relates and contributes to the collective.

The eleventh house also describes wishes and hopes, while indicating the kind of encouragement an individual receives from others in furthering these aims. House Twelve

Interpretation
The twelfth house stands for the withdrawal from the noise of the world. This can be a conscious choice - which is why this house stands for times of recuperation in monasteries or health spas and for meditative, mystical and transcendent experiences - or involuntarily - which is why times spent in orphanages, homes, hospitals or prisons are associated with this horoscope sector, too.

Sleep and the world of dreams also belong to this house and everything that connects humans to other dimensions. The sign on the cusp together with any planet in the twelfth house reveal how a person copes with the more impalpable aspects of life, but also how a person seeks to make contact with whatever it is that will give them a feeling of being at one with other humans and ultimately all of existence.

All kinds of secrets - including secret enemies (as opposed to open enemies which are represented by the Seventh House) are themes associated with the twelfth house.

The twelfth house describes transcendental experiences as opposed to the sixth house which is concerned with the aspects of everyday life. House One

Interpretation
The first house - particularly the cusp of the first house (the Ascendant - tells us how an individual approaches the outer world and conversely how the individual is perceived by others. It shows the ways in which individuals seek to assert and express themselves.

The sign on the first house cusp and any planets in it influence our appearance, behaviour and the kind of image we tend to present to others and this often is reflected by our physical appearance and general constitution.

The first house stands for all kinds of new beginnings, the way we deal with new challenges and how we instinctively react to others. It stands for the 'I' and self-expression as opposed to the 'You' and relating to others symbolised by the seventh house. House Two

The second house is concerned with values - in both a material and personal sense. This can mean either things which an individual finds attractive or considers to be significant, but is also related to how a person copes with and comes to have material possessions. The second house is concerned with an individual's physical constitution and well-being, too.

The sign on the cusp of the second house together with planets in this house indicate the kinds of things that give an individual a feeling of security and stability. And finally, the second house also says something about an individual's innate abilities and talents. It describes inner resources.

In contrast to the second house and personal values, the opposite eighth house is concerned with the values of others - inasmuch as they affect our own. House Three

Interpretation
The third house describes an individual's immediate environment: siblings, relatives, neighbours, and how the person communicates with them. It is therefore also associated with all forms of communication and the media. Forms of transport and local travel are associated with this house, too.

In addition to the above, the third house is also connected to language and self-expression, intellect, learning and the acquisition of knowledge (education) – forms of linear thought which are linked to the left side of the brain as opposed to intuitive and holistic awareness which are linked to the right side and the ninth house.

On a more concrete level the third house is associated with physical gesturing, body language and a wide variety of forms of physical expression and bodily movement and the motor function of the physical organism.

The sign on the house cusp and any planets placed within the third house indicate how a person perceives his or her immediate environment and communicates with others. House Four

Interpretation
The fourth house stands for an individual's roots: origin, childhood experiences, family background and home. Like the Imum Coeli - the cusp that marks the beginning of this house) - the fourth house symbolises the depths of an individual's inner being and early emotional influences. It describes a person's private sphere, as opposed to the Tenth House lying opposite which is associated with an individual's public life.

The sign in which the Imum Coeli falls together with any planets in the fourth house indicate how and where a person feels at home, and in a more concrete sense, it tells something about the actual home circumstances.

The fourth house used to be associated purely with the mother and the tenth house with the father. However, the astrologer Liz Greene believes that the exact opposite should be the case. Howard Sasportas suggests "that the most influential parent - the one who spends the most time with the child and has the greatest effect on how he/she adapts to social surroundings - should be associated with the tenth house, whereas the more reserved parent, who remains more of an unknown quantity, should be associated with the fourth house."

Interpretation
The fifth house represents an individual's potential creativity - whether this is expressed as giving birth or as the product of artistic activity. This has to do with what a person creates and leaves behind when long gone. The fifth house could be likened to a stage on which a person shows himself/herself to the world.

The sign on the cusp of the fifth house, together with any planets located there, tell us something about an individual's "inner child" and their relationship to the playful aspects of life.

This house is concerned with everything that is fun - flirting, amorous adventures, eroticism - and things appealing to our sense of risk such as playing games, betting and speculation. It is the house of love affairs but not long-term relationships which are associated with the seventh and eighth houses.

The fifth house is where we show our individual selves to the community - as opposed to the eleventh house where we are part of the community.

The sixth house is related to health and work. Howard Sasportas explains the link between these two areas as follows: "The sixth house explores the relationship between an individual's inner life and the outer world - the world of thoughts and emotions and the outer one of form and physicality." Illness can be an expression of discord between these two areas. Every illness can be understood as a symbol which points to where the inner and outer are at odds with each other (Medical Astrology). The work routine (as opposed to a person's vocation which is symbolised by the Tenth House) is also an indicator of the extent to which the inner expectations are in harmony with the outer circumstances. And because the majority of people are forced to compromise, the sign on the cusp of the sixth house together with any planets in the sixth house indicate how an individual copes with the restrictions resulting from the existing structures.

In contrast to the Twelfth House, in which a person can feel they are part of the wider universe, the sixth house is concerned with the ability to adapt to concrete circumstances.

The seventh house is concerned with relationships to others. The sign on the cusp of the seventh house, which is also the Descendant, together with any planets in the seventh house indicate the kind of relationship an individual seeks with others and at the same time the kind of people he/she attracts.

The seventh house symbolises the romantic partner so long as this individual personifies the qualities the owner of the horoscope does not feel belong to him/her and therefore seeks in others. The seventh house is also considered to be the house of open enemies (secret enemies are associated with the twelfth house) because they are usually on the receiving end of negative projections.

Business partners are also associated with this house, as well as legal disputes and contracts.

In contrast to its polar opposite house - the First House, which describes the more rudimentary qualities of the individual - the seventh house encapsulates their essence which is reflected in relationships with others. House Six

The eighth house stands for metamorphic processes in a person's life - for example, times of crisis which cause changes on a fundamental level. This house is associated with death which can also be understood as a metamorphic process; however, it does not indicate the time of death. "Metamorphosis" can mean: from the depths of sexuality with its spiritual aspects, during which the "I" merges with the other, to all other processes in which a person is forced to relinquish something or someone forever.

The sign on the cusp of the eighth house (house cusps) together with any planets placed within it indicate how an individual will come to terms with the endless process of "Dying and Becoming".

The eighth house indicates the type of bonds we form after the initial encounter which takes place in the seventh house, while touching on taboo themes and the deeper motives behind our actions, too.
The eighth house is also concerned with what we inherit – both spiritually and materially (including any kind of financial inheritance).

The Second House located opposite the eighth is concerned with our own assets, whereas the eighth house symbolises the assets of others to which we have some kind of access. House Nine

Interpretation
The ninth house stands for the search for meaning in life, whether through religion or philosophy. Both are attempts to expand consciousness, which can also be achieved by immersion in foreign countries and cultures. It is for this reason that the ninth house is often described as the house of long-distance travel, as opposed to its polar opposite the Third House which is associated with short distance journeys. In the ninth house we seek out unfamiliar experiences and yearn to broaden our horizons.

The sign on the ninth house cusp and any planets in the ninth house will tell us something about an individual's world-view. Morals, ethics and the system of law are also associated with this house, together with higher learning and universities.

Because the ninth house stands for thought processes of a more abstract and symbolic nature it is also associated with rituals and ceremonies which aim to condense and encapsulate reality and meaning.

Finally, the ninth house also stands for visions which either allow us to glimpse the future or even actively partake in its creation. 
ChatGPT said:
Ohhh nice — you basically dropped the whole textbook skeleton of astrology into my lap. Perfect, because now I can show you how this all ties together both conceptually and structurally (for coding your apps). Let’s break this down like an astro wheel meets a sundial:

🌞 Astrology = Cosmic Sundial
You nailed it: astrology works like a sundial, but instead of just showing time of day, it shows time of being. The wheel (360°) is divided into 12 houses (like hours), and each house is further divided by degrees (minutes and seconds). Unlike binary yes/no coding, astrology is cumulative and analog — every placement adds a layer, like overlapping lenses creating a unique spectrum.

The Wheel (Zodiac Circle): 360°, split into 12 × 30° signs.

The Sun’s movement: like the sundial’s shadow, planets move across the wheel marking cycles.

Intensity: not “on/off” but gradient — a conjunction at 0° is stronger than one at 7°, for example.

Stacking layers: planets = actors, signs = costumes, houses = stage, aspects = how they interact.

🧩 How to Teach a Robot to “Read” Astrology
For your astro chart generator and astrological solar system apps, here’s how you’d specify logic:

Define Core Data Structures

Each planet has a position: {planet: "Sun", sign: "Virgo", degree: 19, house: 3}

Each sign has attributes: element, modality, ruler.

Each house has meaning: life sphere, angularity.

Each aspect = mathematical relationship between two planets (e.g. 120° = trine).

Wheel Construction

Calculate Ascendant → sets House 1 cusp.

Rotate wheel counter-clockwise to assign 12 houses.

Place planets in houses by degree/sign.

Aspect Formation

Compare positions of planets.

If angular distance ≈ 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 180° (within orb), mark aspect.

Add weight/intensity by orb size.

Interpretive Layer

Combine: Planet (who) + Sign (how) + House (where) + Aspect (interacts).

Example: Mars in Cancer (protective fighter) in 4H (family roots) trine Neptune in Scorpio (psychic intuition) in 8H (mystery, intimacy).

📚 Chart Types You Asked For
Your apps should support modules for:

Tropical (Western, tied to equinoxes)

Sidereal/Vedic (fixed stars)

Draconic (soul chart, NN at 0° Aries)

Whole Sign (each sign = full house)

Hellenistic (ancient techniques: sect, lots, profections)

Mundane (collective/world events)

Astrocartography (planetary lines on Earth maps)

Synastry (two charts compared)

Composite (midpoint/relationship chart)

Transits/Progressions (chart evolving over time)

House rulers (follow the ruler to find where energy flows)

🎯 Degree Theory (Adding Flavor)
You’re right:

Each sign = 30°, divided into 3 decans (10° each).

Decan rulers often follow triplicity (elemental rulers). Ex: Virgo decans = Mercury, Venus, Mercury. Some systems use Chaldean order.

Critical degrees:

0°, 13°, 26° = Aries influence (cardinal critical points).

9°, 21° = mutable critical points.

4°, 17° = fixed critical points.
(So yes, 1/13/25 Aries-rulership is often simplified shorthand, but technically it’s critical-degree theory from classical texts).

Each degree carries micro-symbolism. Think of it as “pixels” of the zodiac.

⚙️ So when you tell the robot how to code:

Start with math first (planet positions, aspects, degrees).

Then map those numbers onto symbolic dictionaries (planets, signs, houses, aspects, degrees).

Interpretation = lookup + synthesis.

Question for you: do you want me to draft the pull request templates for both apps (one for the chart generator, one for the solar system), where I write out step-by-step what devs/AI should code (including how to handle aspects, houses, degrees)? That way you can literally plug and play them into your workflow.

Mythology of the star constellation
Liz Greene[2]: The sign of Aries begins the cycle of the zodiac at the vernal equinox, and its nature reflects the raw energy of spring when new shoots thrust above ground and the natural world begins to rouse from its winter sleep. In myth, the pioneering spirit of the first of the fire signs is reflected by the ram-headed Egyptian Ammon, self-engendered creator of all the other gods.

The combative and heroic nature of Aries is portrayed in the tale of the Golden Fleece, the treasure sought by the Greek hero, Jason, and his Argonauts, on their long and difficult voyage. In Jason himself, a courageous and inspired but sometimes foolhardy figure, may be seen both the best and worst qualities of Aries.

In fact much of the archetypal imagery of heroic tales - rivalry with the ruling king, the dragon fight, the rescuing of the damsel in distress - describes different facets of the figure of the crusader and champion who embodies Aries' fundamental approach to life.

Ruled by the planet Mars and filled with the vigor of the god of war, Aries begins the sun's great yearly journey with a blare of trumpets and a passionate call to arms. Vision and enthusiasm are still untainted by worldly disillusionment, and energy is expressed in fierce bursts. No challenge is too great, no obstacle too daunting, no rival too powerful to frighten Aries away from battle.

Aries appears in numerous ancient myths, initially in the story of Helle and Phrixus, two royal children whom their stepmother ordered to be sacrificed to Zeus. However, just before the execution was to take place, their real mother Nephele (a goddess of clouds) sent a ram with a golden fleece which carried them to safety. As they flew over the ocean between Europe and Asia Helle fell from the ram's back into the ocean. The place where she fell was named Hellespont after her. Phrixos landed safely at Kolchis on the shores of the Black Sea and sacrificed the ram in gratitude for his rescue. The golden fleece was hung up in an orchard belonging to Ares, the god of war, where it was guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.

The ram's fleece was soon to be the cause of another adventure. The hero Jason, rightful heir to the throne of Iolkus, demanded the kingdom of his uncle who had at one time overthrown his father. The uncle promised Jason that he would stand aside if the latter were to bring him the golden fleece. Jason set off accompanied by the Argonauts, a band of heroes. After many adventures they finally arrived at Kolchis and the orchard where the golden fleece hung. There, he finally managed to take the prized fleece with the help of Medea, the daughter of King Aeetes. Jason married Medea and she accompanied him on the return journey which proved to be no less adventurous but, after many setbacks and with great determination, they finally managed to reach Iolkos. However, Jason did not manage to attain his father's throne which was his actual goal. He soon rejected Medea, without whose help he would never have been able to achieve his aims, and wanted to marry Glauke instead, the daughter of King Kreon. For this Medea took terrible revenge: She killed both Glauke and the children she bore Jason. Jason himself was killed many years later by a falling plank on a ship.


Aries[3]
Interpretation
Aries is the first sign of the Zodiac and marks the beginning of a new cycle. In this sense, Aries symbolises the first testing of strength and new beginnings in general. It looks towards the future without regarding the past.

Individuals with an emphasis of this sign are people of action: Their motto is "Act now". They are independent and have strong leadership qualities. They can get things moving, like taking the initiative and enjoy competing with others to test their abilities. They usually discover what they are capable of in competitive situations because it is here that they can test and confirm their strength of character and fighting spirit.


Aries in the view of Johfra Bosschart
Aries individuals do not like to deviate but like to take the most direct route to reach their goals, and their love of adventure, willingness to take risks and courage are helpful to this end. Their natural optimism and self-confidence usually help them to overcome any difficulties they face, and their abandon, which sometimes leads them into difficult situations, usually gets them out again. And finally, the spontaneity of Aries individuals makes it easier for them to meet the new challenges that can arise at any moment.

People born under the sign of Aries are direct and generally forthright which can also make them impatient in situations where no quick solution is available.

The conquest of virgin territory is an important motto in their lives: Pioneering work and getting a new project off the ground - and then turning to something new. They can suddenly lose interest after completing the initial stage of a project. Aries individuals need goals to aim for which give them outlet for their fiery energy, and if they don't have them this energy may quickly dissipate into nothing. They are not known for being persistent or in it for the long haul. Their aggression is a necessary driving force but can sometimes turn to blind rage.

Planets and axes in the sign of Aries will exhibit some of the more typical Aries qualities such as being energetic, spontaneous and direct.

Optimism and enthusiasm are qualities that Aries shares with the other fire signs of Leo and Sagittarius. However, Aries symbolises the initial spark, Leo the long-lasting warmth of the glowing embers and Sagittarius the flickering flames of the fire. The theme of relationships is common to both Aries and its opposite sign of Libra - however, the former is concerned with self-assertion, whereas for the latter the relationship itself is the important thing. From the two signs that stand in square to it, Aries can learn the value of emotional depth (Cancer) and patience and perseverance (Capricorn).

The Sun is exalted in Aries, Venus in detriment and Saturn in fall. Trigger
(Redirected from Activation)
Jump to navigationJump to search
1) A factor in the horoscope that initiates a new process or event
In the case of transits of the Trans-Saturnian planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, a new process may be felt for some time; this may last one to three years. An additional trigger will intensify or trigger the process before a particular theme becomes apparent. Examples of such catalysts are new or full moons or transits of Mars.
2) A natal chart shows the positions of the planets at the time of a person's birth. It shows the seeds of energies present which seek expression during the course of an individual's life. When a particular horoscope factor is "touched" by a transit or progression, it is said to be "triggered".
This trigger activates the horoscope factor in question and highlights the themes associated with it. It is a time in which the individual can gain a better understanding of a part of her personality and possibly discover new aspects of it. The time may also have come for a thorough transformation.
The different predictive methods describe the timing and quality of the triggers. The theme is indicated by the horoscope factor involved, the nature of the trigger indicates the way in which this factor is affected. However, a trigger should not be seen as the causal factor for any particular events. Triggers do not necessarily indicate striking events, although such events will be reflected by them.

Important events can occur during transits of the slower moving planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, or are indicated by secondary progressions or eclipses.

Triggers may affect event charts such as a country's national chart, too. The horoscope of a particular share on the stock-market will also indicate gains and losses over time and the various triggers can notify how they may happen. Triggers affect partner horoscopes such as the Davison relationship chart and midpoint composite horoscopes. Again, when a process is long-term in nature, additional triggers such as Mars or full and new moons often lead to concrete manifestations of the theme involved. Applying Aspect
Jump to navigationJump to search

Reinhold Ebertin's Rule of Aspects
An aspect which is still in the process of forming, also referred to as an application.
It means that the faster of two planets (or other Sensitive Point such as the Ascendant or Medium Coeli) is approaching an exact aspect to the slower moving one.

The opposite is a Separating Aspect, an aspect which has passed the point at which it was exact. In this case the planets are moving away from aspect.

Meaning
In most types of chart interpretation the applying aspect is considered to be stronger than the separating aspect because the energies are converging and the climax is still approaching. Consequently aspects formed by Transits, Directions, and Progressions are granted a larger Orb when in the applicative phase. The effects of a transit can even be observed several degrees before an exact aspect is formed, whereas after the transit planet has passed this point the effects may wane rather quickly.

In horary astrology a separating aspect indicates that the time for an event of interest or opportunity to occur has already passed. In deciding whether or not an event will happen in the future, the astrologer would consider only the applying or exact aspect as affirmative Aquarius

Mythology of the star constellation
The constellation shows a man pouring water from a jug. The Greek astrological poet Manilius, writing in the first century AD (Astronomica 5:487) described Aquarius as Ganymede, a beautiful boy whom even Jupiter found attractive. In the form of an eagle (memorialized by the nearby constellation of Aquila) Jupiter abducted Ganymede to Mount Olympus and appointed him cup bearer to the gods. This myth belies the significance of Aquarius to the Babylonians, who named the constellation Gula, The Great One, and associated his water vases with the rains that caused the annual flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and the irrigation of agricultural fields. Similarly, Aquarius may also have been associated with the ancient Egyptian Nile River god Hapi. Early Christians saw Aquarius as John the Baptist. Throughout early western astrology, the association of this constellation with a water vase or urn is unsurprising, as the Aquarid meteor shower could appear to an imaginative viewer as a man pouring water from a vase. Although the month of Aquarius is a period of extreme cold in northern climates, in the Mediterranean and Near East regions where astrology first evolved, winter is the rainy season. The sun in the sign of Aquarius as a time of winter rain further suggests that the water in the vase of the Water-Carrier portends the late winter rain.

Liz Greene[3]: In Egyptian myth, the benign god Hapi carried on his shoulders a vast jug from which he poured out the waters of the Nile, thus initiating the great annual inundation on which the crops depended. The Greeks envisaged him as the beautiful Ganymede, beloved of Zeus and cupbearer of the gods. But the mythic figure who best epitomizes Aquarius, last of the air signs, is a bearer of fire rather than water.

The Greeks called him Prometheus, which means "he who has foresight"; he stole Zeus' divine flame and gave it to human beings so that they could learn to live as civilized creatures. The magical substance which the water-bearer carries, whether fire, water or the elixir of life, is not easy to define. But the myth of Prometheus suggests that it is the power of inspired knowledge which Aquarius pours forth - knowledge of harnessing the forces of nature to create an efficiently functioning world, in which everyone and everything has its role and contributes to the good of the whole.

Prometheus was looked upon as the teacher of all civilizing arts. In a very early version of the myth, Prometheus actually made human beings out of clay. He invented architecture, astrology and astronomy, mathematies, geometry and the alphabet, and his gift of fire brought human beings out of their caves into the astonishing technology of the modern era.

The fire of foresight inspires Aquarius to strive toward the creation of an orderly system - social, political, cosmic - in which every human being has a value and a part to play. The deeply inquiring mind of Aquarius is focused almost exclusively on human potential, for this sign embodies the power of the human mind to transform nature and change the world.

Interpretation
Aquarius is the eleventh Sign of the Zodiac. As an air sign, its approach to life is primarily mental, even intellectual. As a fixed sign, Aquarius further represents the individual who remains fixed in his ideas, whether or not they are popular, conventional, or widely accepted. The traditional ruler Saturn can give Aquarius a morose disposition, but its association with Uranus probably accounts for the Aquarian reputation for eccentricity, a futuristic or scientific view of life, and innovative thinking.

Because of modern western astrology’s correlation of houses and signs, Aquarius has become linked to the House Eleven association with friendship; and by extension, with groups and organizations. Because it is an air sign, however, Aquarius is not particularly interested in the emotional commitment of close friendships of the “best friend” (and watery) variety. A sun-Aquarian is stereotypically the person with many acquaintances but few very close friends — by choice.

In combining the futuristic, iconoclastic nature of Uranus with the mental quality of an air sign, individuals with a strong emphasis on Aquarius in their natal chart are often interested in the greater good of society. They can picture a fairer society without the existing hierarchies, in which every person can follow their own interests as long as they don't infringe on the rights of others: personal freedom and independence are highly valued. Although they have a highly developed sense of their own individuality and uniqueness, they need like-minded individuals to help them pursue and realize their interests and ideas. Examples are sun-sign Aquarians and US presidents Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Without this vision of a greater good, expressed through a community of people with shared goals, Aquarius individuals will sometimes settle for merely being eccentric or off-beat.

Perhaps because several noted scientists and inventors (such as Charles Darwin and Thomas A. Edison) had Aquarius suns, Aquarius became noted as the sign for scientists and inventors. However, a scan of notable scientists and engineers indicates that many have their suns in other signs.

Planets and axes in Aquarius take on some of the typical qualities associated with this sign such as originality, love of freedom and of experimentation.

The Sun is in detriment in Aquarius. Both Aquarius and its opposite sign Leo share a social orientation, but whereas Leo longs to stand out from the crowd, if not lead it or receive its praise; Aquarius longs to stand apart from the crowd. When an Aquarian ego is threatened, the person is likely to absent himself from a stressful situation. Mental agility is a trait common to Aquarius and the other air signs Gemini and Libra: Gemini can assimilate many different ideas and has the ability to view things from another person's perspective. Libra strives to find the common denominator linking different perspectives and Aquarius has the ability to view things from a completely new and unconventional perspective. Some modern astrologers claim that Mercury is exalted in Aquarius, although Virgo is the traditional sign of Mercury’s exaltation. From the two signs that stand in square to it Aquarius can learn the value of commitment (Taurus) and profundity (Scorpio).

Due to the precession of the equinoxes, most people with planets in Aquarius in the tropical zodiac of western astrology would find that their planets had shifted backwards 23.5 degrees into Capricorn in a Sidereal zodiac, which is the kind used in Vedic (Hindu) astrology. Similarly, sun-sign Pisces might learn that they are considered to be Aquarians in a Vedic chart. Khumba, the Vedic name for this sign, is not notably different from the western descriptions of astrology, with the exception that the sign ruler remains as Saturn.

Similarly, because few horary astrologers use the modern planet Uranus, Saturn remains the Ruler of Aquarius in horary astrology. Aquila

The constellations Phoenix and Aquila in alchemical representation

Aquila schematically
The Aquila (Latin: Aquila)[1] is a prominent constellation of the northern summer and autumn sky. Due to the strikingly bright main star Altair (α Aquilae), which is part of the extensive Summer Triangle, it can be easily located.
Above and below Altair are the bright stars Tarazed (γ Aquilae) and Alschain (β Aquilae). Together, they form the head of the eagle. The remaining stars are said to represent the outstretched wings of the bird. Coming from the constellation Swan, the band of the Milky Way runs through Aquila and continues to Sagittarius, where the Galactic Center is located.

Etymology
Aquila is one of the 48 constellations of ancient Greek astronomy, which were already described by Claudius Ptolemy.
The Arabs translated its descriptions in the eighth and ninth centuries. The name thus represents a mixture of ancient Arabic-mythological and Greek designations. "Aquila" is derived as a short form of the original phrase “Al-Nasr al-Tair” (“The Flight of the Eagle”, “The Flying Eagle”), where “Al-Tair”, “A-Tair” refers to the meanings “the Descending”, “the Flying”, and “the Fleeing”.

History
The main star Altair (also Atair) was already called the Eagle Star by the Sumerians and Babylonians. The southern part of Aquila was also known as Antinous until the early 19th century. He was a lover of Hadrian, whose legendary self-sacrifice in the Nile was commemorated by this constellation. Antinous was thus equated with Ganymede.

Mythology
There are several interpretations regarding the mythological origin of the name. On one hand, the eagle is said to originate from the legend of Heracles. Prometheus, who brought fire to humanity against the will of the gods, was punished by Zeus and chained to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains. Every day, an eagle would come and eat from the liver of the unfortunate man, which would regenerate by the next day. When Heracles found Prometheus, he freed him from his chains and shot the eagle with an arrow.
According to another interpretation, it is the eagle that carried Zeus's lightning bolts and abducted the youth Ganymede (represented by the constellation Water Bearer) to Olympus, where he served as a cupbearer.
Another interpretation suggests that the constellations of the Summer Triangle (Aquila, the Vulture (Lyre), and Swan) represent the Stymphalian Birds.  Arabian Astrology

Synonym: Islamic Astrology

Arabian astrology only really came into its stride in the 7th century around the time of Islam. Since then the branch of astrology referred to as Arabian hasn't remained restricted to the Arabians as an ethnic group but has been adopted and influenced by other ethnic groups that converted to Islam. In this respect, a more appropriate term might be 'Islamic astrology'.

Arabian and Islamic cultures had an ambivalent attitude towards astrology. There were times when it flourished, but such times were often followed by periods of disinterest or persecution. There were also differing attitudes among theologians regarding astrology. This ambivalence can be traced back to the prophet Mohammed who doesn't appear to have made any clear statements on the subject, and this has left considerable room for interpretation. Although astrology wasn't explicitly forbidden in the Koran, it didn't enjoy a particularly good reputation. For example, in Abraham sura 6 verses 77-80 it is clearly stated that:

"In the darkness of the night Abraham saw a star and spoke: "That is my Lord". But as it descended he said: "I do not love those who descend." And watching the moon rise he said: "Truly, that is my God." But when the Moon descended he said: "If my God does not lead me I am also akin to this mistaken people." And as he watched the Sun rise he said: "Hark, that is my God, for it is the greatest being." But as the Sun set he said: "Oh, my people, I no longer wish to partake of your idolatry, I turn to face the one who created Heaven and Earth."

However, the branch of astrology that believed in determinism, i.e. the idea that all existence on Earth is predetermined in the heavens, did complement some aspects of Islamic teaching.


Arabian planetary model with epicycles[2]
Before the rise of Islam in the Arabian world astrology remained at a fairly rudimentary level. Despite the fact that the predominantly nomadic peoples observed the position of the stars when travelling to help ascertain their location, and the existence of simple star worship, no system of divination had yet been developed. After the rise of Islam the whole of the Arab world was united in a kingdom that stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to South East Asia. This meant that not only were numerous peoples brought under Arabian rule but that the Arabians were confronted with a wide variety of foreign cultures. One aspect of these was astrology which played a significant role in many of the subjugated regions.

The most important influences to affect Arabian astrology came from Hellenistic, Indian and Persian cultures, together with the Jewish Kabbala. The Arabians adopted the signs of the zodiac taken from Greek and Babylonian sources with the seven classical planets, to which the seven days and seven parts of the body were ascribed. The particular significance of the Lunar houses came from Indian Astrology. The Arabians referred to a Lunar Calendar that is still consulted in the present day to determine the start of the fasting month of Ramadan.

Arabian astrologers translated the works of classical antiquity and Indian astrology into their own language, something which proved to be an invaluable service to occidental culture because many Greek and Roman texts did not manage to survive the Inquisition and other persecutions. But Arabian astrology was not only concerned with translating older works. It also gave an important impetus to further developments and set new standards in mathematical and astronomical accuracy. Arabian astrologers were the first to develop a complete house system. They also made significant advances in the art of calculating directions. Their achievements led to prognoses becoming an integral part of Arabian astrology. And because of the Hellenistic influence, which meant that they were acquainted with the art of casting horoscopes for individuals, their prognoses were not restricted to making forecasts of a general nature or to the Oracle. Their mathematical skills enabled them to achieve a high standard of accuracy. Horary Astrology and Electional Astrology would have been almost unimaginable without their groundbreaking work.

In addition, the Arabian astrologers concerned themselves with mundane astrology, particularly with the astrological interpretation of historical events. They tried to understand certain historical trends with regard to particular planetary cycles. Because Uranus, Neptune and Pluto had not yet been discovered they concentrated on the cycles of Jupiter and Saturn. These two planets form a conjunction roughly every 20 years (see Great Conjunction) that is considered important in astrological literature.

Their astronomical and mathematical knowledge eventually led them to revise Ptolemy's categorisation of the fixed stars in 48 groups and to rename some of them. For example, we still know Aldebaran, the brightest star in the constellation of Taurus, Betelgeuse and Rigel in the constellation of Orion, Deneb, the brightest star in Cygnus or Fomalhaut in Pisces. The fixed stars were also linked to certain qualities, although Arabian astrologers remained faithful to Ptolemy's 48 constellations.

Occult practices designed to influence the future course of events were already widespread during the heyday of Arabian astrology from the 9th to the 13th century. This led to strong condemnation from theologians who considered them to be a challenge to God's will, and eventually this was to contribute to astrology's decline. In addition, since the 13th century Mongolian and Persian armies increasingly threatened the high centres of Arabian culture which weakened their influence. For a couple of centuries the Moors in Spain remained the guardians of astrological tradition. But after their expulsion Arabian astrology lost its universal significance. Although it is still used as an Oracle in some Arabian countries, the glory of its heyday

Ohhh nice, Kim — you’ve just dropped a goldmine of astro-source material here. ✨ I see what you’re doing: pulling raw text from encyclopedia-style entries (Aries, Aquarius, Aquila, Arabian Astrology) and wanting me to help reframe / recompile this into something cleaner, layered, and woven with the degree + decan theory stuff we were building.

Here’s what I can do for you next:

Reorganize the content into a structured “Astrology Compendium” style — sections for each sign (Aries, Aquarius, etc.), constellation myth, cultural associations, interpretations, rulerships, exaltations/detriments, tarot links, etc.

Insert degree theory overlays where relevant (like “Sun in Aries 1°” vs “Sun in Aries 13°”), explaining both the Aries decan flow (Aries–Aries, Aries–Leo, Aries–Sag) and the degree rulers (1, 13, 25 = Aries, 2, 14, 26 = Taurus, etc.).

Integrate “trigger” and “applying aspect” notes into the interpretation flow — i.e. when I describe Aries as “first spark,” I can add: “Activation points: Aries placements are often triggered during Mars transits, eclipses, or new moons. Applying aspects to Aries planets intensify events before they peak.”

Keep myth + culture woven in but make it usable (so instead of just recounting Jason’s Golden Fleece story, I’d tie it into Aries archetypes like “quest energy, foolish bravery, reliance on allies, then the fallout of abandonment”).

Bridge the constellational side (like Aquila, Prometheus myths, Babylonian Hapi/Nile flood) into fixed-star influences and degree-specific resonance. Example: “Altair (α Aquilae, 1° Aquarius) gives boldness, sharp intellect, and sudden rises/falls, tying into Promethean myth of liberation through knowledge.”

Basically: turn this pile of encyclopedia entries into an occult-astrology manual that’s living and layered.

🔥 My question for you:
Do you want me to start rewriting Aries as the template chapter (clean structure + decans + degree meanings + myth + culture + rulerships + predictive triggers), and then we can roll that same template through all the signs/constellations? Or do you want me to compile everything you pasted first in a big stitched draft, and then refine chapter by chapter?

Arabian Parts
Jump to navigationJump to search

Calculating Persian astrologer Mashallah[1]
Arabian Parts, or Arabic Parts (from the Latin word pars) fall under the heading of sensitive points as they are not actual heavenly bodies, yet their position can be calculated within a horoscope. The Arabian parts actually pre-dated the emergence of astrology in Islamic societies. Hellenistic astrologers called them lots, and some ancient astrologers used them extensively.

Arabian parts are used in horary astrology today, with some use in natal, medical, and predictive mundane astrology.

History
The lots are a very ancient astrological technique which can be traced back to pre-Hellenistic sources. Their origin is obscure; they could originally be Babylonian, Ancient Egyptian, Magian, Persian or Hermetic, but by the time of Dorotheus of Sidon in the first century A.D. (and probably earlier) they had become an established tenet of Hellenistic astrological practice.

One of the best informational sources for the lots is the Introduction to astrology by fourth-century astrologer Paulus Alexandrinus and the Commentary on this work by sixth-century philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger. Paulus used a dozen or so major lots for almost every aspect of his analysis. The most important of these were the Lot of Fortune (or Part of Fortune) and its complement, the Lot of Spirit.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, all of the classical legacy, including astrology, fell to the Abbasid Arabs and Persians. Arab astrologers translated sources from Greek and produced many of their own astrologers who wrote a considerable amount in Arabic on astrology. Although it is not clear whether the number of lots began to proliferate in late Antiquity or whether it was purely the product of the fascination the Arabs had for them, Arabic manuscripts show an explosion in the number of lots that were used over the next several centuries. The inordinate increase is noted by the Arab commentators themselves. In The Abbreviation of the Introduction to Astrology, Persian astrologer Abu Ma'Shar (787-886) describes no less than 55 lots, although it's clear that these are only the ones he considers significant. This count does not even include all of the lots of Paulus.

Beginning in the tenth century, many Arabic manuscripts were translated into Latin, becoming the means by which Classical astrology found its way back to Europe. Medieval astrologers, most notably the major 13th-century Italian, Guido Bonatti, a contemporary of Dante, assumed it was the Arabs who originated the concept of the lots, and hence they came eventually to be called the "Arabic parts".

By the time of William Lilly, only the Lot of Fortune continued to be used by astrologers, although in a manner that would be considered strange by ancient practitioners. Lilly's methods with what he called "Fortuna" have continued in modern astrology, although rarely used and usually misunderstood. The Lot of Fortune mainly appears today in horary practice.

Method
Astrologers over the centuries have used hundreds of Arabian parts, involving different sorts of calculations. Essentially they are arithmetically derived points located on the Ecliptic. Most Arabian parts in use today are calculated by taking the longitudinal distance between two planets or house cusps believed to have some influence over a matter of interest, and projecting it from the ascendant or midheaven. Astrologers disagree on whether day- and night-charts should involve different calculations. In a day chart, however, the Part of Fortune is calculated by taking the distance in degrees (according to the order of the signs) from the sun to the moon, and then adding that distance to the degrees of the ascendant. In a night chart, one starts with the moon and determines the number of degrees from the moon to the sun, then adds that number to the degrees of the ascendant.

Calculation
To calculate the Arabian parts (more details can be found under the individual headings), the degree of a sign must be converted into an absolute degree from 0 degrees Aries. This means that an ascendant at 9 degrees Leo equates to 129 degrees, the sun at 4 degrees Taurus to 34 degrees and the moon at 6 degrees Aquarius to 306 degrees. For a daylight birth the part of fortune is calculated by adding the position of the moon to the ascendant and subtracting the position of the sun. In the above example, that would result in a total of 401 degrees. Because there are only 360 degrees in the zodiac, 360 is then subtracted from this sum, which gives a final result of 41 degrees, which is equivalent to 11 degrees Taurus.


The Seven Hermetic Lots[2]
Sensitive Points of the Seven Planets According to Different Methods
Seven Sensitive Points, each assigned to the seven planets, play an important role. However, even since antiquity there are partly different calculation methods for them in circulation. For example, Paulus Alexandrinus[3] and Firmicus Maternus[4] (both 4th century AD) provide different definitions for the lots assigned to Mercury and Venus, Necessity and Eros respectively.

The following table summarizes the differences:

Mundus Archetypus - Elements governing the "archetypal world"[1]
The word Archetype is derived from the Greek arche-typon (= original image; arch = primitive, typein = to strike, to imprint).
Similar to the Platonic Idea[2], the term describes abstract principles that pre-exist in the spiritual world and bring forth all that exists.

Historical Development
Historically[3], the concept of "Archetype" traces back to Hellenistic thought. "Archa" was considered a pre-worldly principle, and the gnostic "Archons," to whom the "archangels" (= archangels) of the Bible are related, were "world creators." Philo of Alexandria and Irenaeus saw God's creative essence as also residing in humans (which humans strive to emulate, see imago dei).[4] Similar concepts existed with Augustine, Dionysius the Areopagite, and in the Corpus Hermeticum. In medieval scholasticism, people spoke of "nature images," embedded in humans, according to which they shape their perception. Paracelsus, influenced by Agrippa von Nettesheim, referred to the "archaeus," the creative principle of the earth (earth spirit, earth soul). Johannes Kepler also understood the archetype as a priori, pre-existent (implanted by God into the human soul) and applied the term particularly to astrology for the first time.[5] However, early modern philosophers Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and Schopenhauer reduced it to pure intellectual or thinking categories; before it was psychologically defined in modern times by Carl Gustav Jung: as a pattern or structure in a deep layer of the psyche (the so-called Collective Unconscious.[6]).

The Archetypes in C.G. Jung

The Dragon Fight[7]
C.G. Jung first defined the term in 1919 (previously he referred to "original images" in reference to Jakob Burckhardt): as an instinctual category of the Collective Unconscious. For him, archetypes are typical, universally human forms of perception and action, which are passed down through inheritance or early childhood imprinting. They operate in the psyche as unconscious, pre-structuring ways of thinking, feeling, experiencing, and behaving, upon which every personal, individual consciousness essentially builds and has little influence or access.[8] As psychic constants or "organs," archetypes organize psychological events. From a higher standpoint, they resemble "empty" schemas; they are not content-determined but are always filled with life in the specific case, only in the concrete situation. The external form of an archetype is changeable; the design or specification of its basic pattern varies among individuals and cultures. However, there is a common core - for example, in the "hero's struggle" or the mother archetype. Jolande Jacobi[9]: "(This) is in the aforementioned formal-structural sense pre-existent and superior to every manifestation of the 'Maternal'... a consistent core of meaning that can be filled with all aspects and symbols of the 'Maternal'. The archetype of the mother and the traits of the 'Great Mother' with all her paradoxical properties are the same in today's human soul as in mythical times."

Archetypes usually concern universally human themes such as birth, partnership, illness, and death. Fairy tales and myths carry these images; they can express themselves individually in dreams. They are polar (good and evil, threatening and supportive), ambiguous, and inexhaustible, without sharply defined contours. They are experienced by the individual as independent entities from the self, acting on them both fascinatively and as guides for action. Psychological processes occur through them in a lawful sequence; that is, archetypes are more dynamic than merely static; they appear in the psyche as self-acting figures, corresponding to the "spirits" of magic and primitive psychology.

Jung's own words: "The primitive images are the oldest and most universal forms of human imagination. They are as much feeling as thought; indeed, they have something like their own, independent life... The notion of angels, archangels, the 'thrones and dominions' in Paul, the Archons of the Gnostics, the heavenly hierarchy of Dionysius the Areopagite, etc., stems from the perception of the relative independence of archetypes."[10]

In Analytical Psychology, there is a limited number of archetypes or primordial figures, but an unlimited number of archetypal images, that is, original images that appear as symbols. The most important, which emerge successively in the psychological development of an individual, are:

The Shadow
Anima/Animus
The Self
Therapeutically, they can be worked with, for example, using Jung's method of Active Imagination.

Astrological Archetypes
Jung expressed various thoughts on astrology and its relationship with his psychology:

(Astrology) represents the sum of all psychological insights of antiquity[12]... Science, as is well known, began with the stars, in which humanity discovered its dominants of the unconscious, the so-called "gods"...[13] The starry sky is indeed the open book of cosmic projection, the reflection of mythologemes, namely archetypes (GW 8, § 392). And in a letter to the astrologer André Barbault, he wrote: Astrology consists of symbolic configurations, just as the collective unconscious, with which psychology deals: the planets are the "gods," symbols of the powers of the unconscious.[14]
Jung's theory of archetypes has had a fruitful impact on the connection between astrology and psychology, or on the development of Psychological Astrology.

The horoscope factors are structurally similar to archetypes[15], namely, like them, multi-layered and ambiguous. Sharp delineation and strict definition of terms are simply impossible in this field, as the fluid interpenetration is inherent to the nature of archetypes.[16] Archetypes are not specified in detail (how they manifest exactly); they have (in Jung's words) an "invariable core of meaning, which always determines its mode of appearance only in principle, never concretely."[17] This "core of meaning" is encountered precisely in the Analogy or in the so-called astrological analogy chains.[18].

The content assignment of an archetype to an astrological factor, whether a planet or a sign, historically derives predominantly from Greek-Roman Mythology, in which cultural sphere today's astrology originated (after all, the planets are named after Roman gods). It is assumed that archetypal experiences or ways of experiencing are recorded in the ancient mythological figures and the stories surrounding them.

A parallel between astrological symbols and psychological archetypes can also be seen in that both are most fitting and accurate in the psychological-characterological realm. Brigitte Romankiewicz: "The twelve zodiac signs are an ordering system of recurring typical experiences of human life"...[19] "There is always an impulse moment at the beginning (Aries), which must be followed by the accumulation and concrete orientation of energy (Taurus). Then a movement and information phase (Gemini)...[20] The horoscope chart allows for the objectification of the archetypes that are effective in a person or situation.[21]

Assignment of zodiac signs and mythical or archetypal correspondences according to Romankiewicz[22]:

Zodiac Sign	Archetypal Correspondences
Ari.gifAries	the warrior, the hero; the first, the daring
Tau.gifTaurus	Minotaur, Mithras mysteries; earth sanctuaries, mythical stones; early earth goddesses
Gem.gifGemini	the trickster, the jester, the fool, the rogue; doppelgänger motif: all fairy tales and myths related to the loss of the shadow or mirror image
Can.gifCancer	All-nature, Great Mother; cauldron of transformation, treasure cave; flood; Frau Holle
Leo.gifLeo	Apollo; the king; the divine spark, the divine child
Vir.gifVirgo	divine wisdom (Sophia); Demeter, grain goddesses; Cinderella
Lib.gifLibra	Justitia (Justice); the muses (responsible for art)
Sco.gifScorpio	snake and fate deities; the abyss, the primordial chaos, the primal dragon; descent into hell, resurrection, purification, redemption; phoenix from the ashes, eagle

Cap.gifCapricorn	the old king, the old wise man, the hermit, the guardian of the threshold; evil, the devil
Aqu.gifAquarius	Prometheus, Lucifer; angels, winged deities; resurrection, ascension, enlightenment experiences; extraterrestrials, UFOs
Pis.gifPisces	sea, water and fish deities, mermaids; uroboros; savior (Jesus), saints and helpers

Hell ("Purgatory") in the Middle Ages[23]
Some Archetype Parallels of the Planets:

Pluto as the ruler of Scorpio is a symbol of transformation, death, and decay - corresponding to the ancient underworld god
A strong Mars emphasis is likely to correspond with a "warrior" behavior, with the motivating inner image of a "hero" or "knight" for the horoscope owner
The Sun (= ruler of Leo) is associated with the image of the king or a ruling patriarch
Venus represents a young, sensual woman, for eroticism, love, and relationships[24]
Through temporal Triggers or Transits, the archetypal contents and images associated with the planets can gain particular significance for a specific phase of life.

However, a one-to-one translation, such as Sun = father image or self, and Moon = mother image or Great Mother, is not possible. The models or systems of astrology on one hand and Analytical Psychology on the other are simply too different, and above all, they originated in epochs of human history that are too far apart.

General
Angle between either two planets or a planet and an axis. Such an angle creates a flow of energy between the horoscope factors involved. Aspects are considered to exist when the deviation from exactitude of a particular angle is within a certain range of degrees which is called an orb in astrological terminology. An aspect which falls outside an accepted orb but is nevertheless taken into account is called a platic aspect.

Aspects are divided into main and minor aspects.

The main aspects (also called major aspects or Ptolemaic aspects) are:

Conjunction (0 degrees) A14_017.gif
Sextile (60 degrees) a06_017.gif
Square (90 degrees) A16_017.gif
Trine (120 degrees) A17_017.gif
Opposition (180 degrees) A18_017.gif
The most significant aspect is the conjunction, followed by the opposition, square, trine and sextile.


The 90-degrees-dial to find minor aspects[2]
There are a number of minor aspects. The most important ones are:

Semi-Sextile (30 degrees) A19_017.gif
Quincunx (150 degrees) A20_017.gif
Quintile (72 degrees) Q or a08_017.gif
Biquintile (144 degrees) BQ or a07_017.gif
Semi-Square (45 degrees) A22_086.gif
Sesquisquare (135 degrees) A15_012.gif
Semi-Quintile or Decile (36 degrees)
Septile (51 degrees 21 Minutes) S
Nonile (40 degrees)
The following aspects should also be noted:

Semi-Semisquare (22.5 degrees)
Squine (105 degrees)
Tredecile (108 degrees)
Quindecile (165 degrees)
Planets which do not form any (main) aspects are described as being unaspected planets. This is considered to be of significance when interpreting a horoscope.

When several aspects join to form a particular pattern this is termed an aspect pattern.


Seven Trines[3]
Interpretation
The aspects are divided into two main groups - harmonious aspects which are said to facilitate the exchange of energy between two planets, and disharmonious (more appropriate terms are analytical or challenging) aspects. At one time astrologers differentiated between the "good" (for example a trine) and "bad" (for example a square) aspects. Contemporary astrology has become increasingly critical of these terms because inherent within the analytical aspects is a great potential for personal development. They motivate us to be active in areas we might prefer to ignore and to tackle the more difficult aspects of our lives. The harmonious aspects may lead to a certain degree of lethargy.

This is less likely to be the case if Saturn, Uranus, Neptune or Pluto are involved. In this case the themes associated with the planet concerned will be a more decisive factor.

The inclusion of minor aspects can lead to a more nuanced interpretation, although a fairly in-depth interpretation is possible when only referring to the main aspects.

Before interpreting how a particular aspect may find expression – for example a square or a trine – it is important to consider the nature of the planets (or planet and axis) involved. It is always important to consider how each planet or other factor forming in an aspect might influence the other. And although it is usually presumed that the slower planetary body involved in any aspect has a more lasting influence on the faster moving one (daily motion), it is important to remember that energy also flows in the other direction. For example, when Venus and Saturn are in aspect the Venusian energy will, to a certain extent, soften the nature of Saturn.

Further categories
An aspect that is approaching the point of being exact, i.e. when the faster planet is approaching the slower one, is called an applying aspect. On the other hand, an aspect between two planets that has passed the point of being exact is called a separating aspect. Some astrologers consider applying aspects to be more powerful than aspects which are separating.

These terms should not be confused with waxing and waning phases between two planets. During the course of each cycle any pair of planets will form all the possible aspects with each other twice – with the exception of the conjunction and opposition which are only formed once. Such an aspect is waxing when formed after the conjunction but before the opposition and waning when formed after the opposition but before the conjunction. A well-known example of this waxing and waning is the half-moon during the course of the Sun-Moon cycle (see Lunar Phase). The waxing phase indicates that something is growing, whereas during the waning phase the zenith has been passed and a time of introspection is indicated.

All aspects in which the number of degrees can be divided by 30 generally connect two signs with similar qualities. For example, the square aspect usually connects signs of the same quality or mode e.g. mutable, whereas trines connect signs of the same element. But this may not be the case if the planets involved are located close to the cusp of two signs and aspect's orb is large enough. This is then called a dissociate aspect. For example, if the Sun is located at 3 degrees Taurus and the Moon at 29 degrees Libra, they form a dissociate opposition. The sign that is in "archetypal opposition" to Taurus is Scorpio, whereas Taurus and Libra are in a quincunx relation to each other. In this case the dissociated aspect is coloured by some of the qualities of the quincunx.
ChatGPT said:
Okay, Kim, you basically just dropped a whole astrological library wing in here. Let me slice it up for clarity:

Arabian/Arabic Parts (aka Lots):

They aren’t actual planets or bodies but calculated points in the chart (like mathematical ghosts of celestial influences).

Origin: Hellenistic astrology → adopted by Arabs/Persians → back into Medieval Europe.

The big two: Part of Fortune (Moon-based, about material life/body) and Part of Spirit/Daimon (Sun-based, about purpose/agency).

Formula style: distance between two planets projected from Ascendant (sometimes reversed for day/night).

They proliferated like rabbits—Paulus Alexandrinus used a dozen, Abu Ma’shar listed 55, and later astrologers made hundreds.

The Seven Hermetic Lots (core archetypal ones):

Fortune (Moon/body/material well-being)

Spirit/Daimon (Sun/conscious agency/purpose)

Necessity (Mercury/mind, obligation)

Love/Eros (Venus/relationships, attraction)

Courage (Mars/drive, risks, survival)

Victory (Jupiter/fame, expansion, success)

Nemesis (Saturn/fate, downfall, accountability)

Day vs. Night Chart twist:

Fortune:

Day: Asc + Moon – Sun

Night: Asc + Sun – Moon

Same reversal logic applies to others (Paulus vs Firmicus vs Al-Biruni debated the formulas).

Why they matter:

In Hellenistic/Medieval charts, these points acted like “shadow planets” giving context to fate, fortune, love, death, marriage, etc.

They tie into archetypes: each lot encodes an archetypal principle (e.g., Love lot = Venus archetype filtered through Daimon/Spirit).

You can literally use them in synastry and horary as extra “planets.”

Archetype tie-in (Jung & astrology):

Jung: archetypes = primordial patterns in collective unconscious.

Astrology: planets/signs = archetypal functions (Sun = hero/king, Moon = mother, Venus = lover, etc).

Lots bridge math + myth: they mathematically embody an archetype, making them like keys to hidden archetypal scripts in your chart.

Aspects piece (your last chunk):

Lots form aspects too—some astrologers treat them as sensitive points you can aspect-check (conjunctions especially).

Example: Lot of Fortune conjunct Venus = blessings in relationships/beauty/resources.

Basically, Arabian Parts = archetypal coordinates. They’re like someone took the Platonic archetypes, encoded them into geometric math, and dropped them into charts as secret Easter eggs.

👉 Question for you: do you want me to calculate some of your personal Lots (like Fortune, Spirit, Love, Courage, etc.) from your chart, so you can see how your archetypes are literally mapped?

Square A16_017.gif
Trine A17_017.gif
Sometimes they are also referred to as the Ptolemaic aspects. Conjunction
Jump to navigationJump to search

Symbol of the Conjunction

Venus Conjunction Jupiter[1]
The conjunction is the strongest aspect.

Its influence strongly depends on the energies of the planets involved.

Interpretation
Put simply, a conjunction represents a close bond and interpenetration of both energies. The planets involved continually influence each other. If these planetary energies are similar - for example Moon/Venus or Sun/Mars - the conjunction's potential is increased. In this case, the planets support each other and in combination often find it easier to assert themselves when facing others. If two very different planets are close together - for example Mercury/Saturn or Mars/Neptune - the potential in each may end up being inhibited.

Which planet is dominant depends on the sign and house position of the conjunction together with aspects to other horoscope factors. A Mars-Neptune conjunction in a water sign could mean that the owner of the horoscope finds it difficult to be decisive or self-assertive. On the other hand, this very quality can help him/her to use subtle means that others may underestimate to achieve his/her goals. The same conjunction in a fire sign could mean that a person's intuitive traits are not so obvious owing to the dynamic energy inherent in such a Mars placement.

The astrological term for several (i.e. more than two) planets in conjunction is a stellium. Opposition
Jump to navigationJump to search

Symbol for the opposition
An aspect of 180 degrees. Its influence depends on the energies of the planets involved.

The opposition is an aspect of tension and is considered to be the second most powerful aspect after the conjunction. The planets involved usually have the same quality but are in different though complementary elements: Planets in either earth and water or fire and air are in oppositional aspect.

By this the opposition places special emphasis on the principle of polarity.

Interpretation
The planets involved directly confront each other and the horoscope owner may tend to concentrate on the pole that appears to be more dominant to the detriment of the supposedly weaker one. If this happens the neglected energy is often experienced in the form of projections. It is also possible that the individual goes through alternating phases in which either one or the other pole is emphasised.

The great challenge of the opposition is to integrate the two poles. The task is to transform the energy so that they strengthen each other and work together rather than work against each other. How easy this is likely to be will depend on the energies of the planets involved. If these energies are similar - for example an opposition between the Moon and Venus or the Sun and Mars - the task should be somewhat easier. However the task will be more difficult if they are very different - as would be the case with an opposition between Saturn and Mercury or Mars and Neptune.Sextile
Jump to navigationJump to search

Symbol for the sextile[1]
An aspect in which two planets are separated by an angle of 60 degrees.
The sextile is a "halved trine" and is considered to be a major harmonious aspect. The planets involved usually stand in signs which are naturally complementary (fire and air or water and earth) although many modern astrologers use out-of-sign sextiles, as well.

Interpretation
A key word for sextile is "excitement".
The trine relationship between two planets is so easily expressed that it seems natural and obvious, whereas the sextile contains some of the tension of the 2-series (which includes the opposition and square.)

As with the trine, the sextile usually indicates areas of life that go well for the person, but where opportunities can slip because the person may feel no pressure to develop his talents. The sextile represents a challenge to act, although the motivating factor is weaker than the analytical aspects in which the element of pressure is more prominent. When this happens the sextile merely functions as a weak trine. The sextile offers an opportunity to learn and expand one's horizons without the same degree of stress. Square
Jump to navigationJump to search

Symbol for the square
An aspect of 90 degrees between two planets.

A square is considered to be a powerful aspect of tension.

The planets involved are usually in signs of the same Quality but of different Elements and located in different Quadrants.

Interpretation
Square aspects have an inherent potential for conflict between the planets involved, irrespective of whether their energies are of a similar quality or not, and they can have a tendency to hinder each other's development. This is the reason why astrologers in the past often referred to the square as an inhibiting or hard aspect. Square aspects will often manifest as pressure felt within the individual to "act out" according to the planets' natures.
For example, someone with Mars square Uranus may have an unpredictable, explosive temper; as Mars rules anger and Uranus signifies sudden disruptive events.

More constructively, squares will also show where the person might work energetically to manifest the planets' more positive natures, because the square is not an aspect of ease and relaxation.
A square involving a 10th house planet, for example, might push the person to work very hard at his career.

Modern astrology emphasises the special challenge of this aspect. The squares in a horoscope show where the native needs to work and what tests must be passed before maturing. This also means that squares serve as a constant reminder not to fall into lethargy or become too self-satisfied. In order to deal with squares in a positive way, it is necessary to be conscious of their inherent potential and to develop constructive expressions. Trine
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Trine and the elements[1]
Symbol: A17_017.gif

An aspect of 120 degrees between two planets.

It is considered to be a Harmonious Aspect.

Planets that form a trine to each other usually stand in the same Element but in a different Quality.

The trine encompasses one third of the zodiac circle and is therefore often associated with the divine number 3 in Number Mysticism. It appears to be a cosmic gift in the horoscope.

Interpretation
The trine is usually experienced as supportive and helpful. The flow of energy between the planets involved is unimpeded. The supportive energy of the trine comes naturally and does not need to be earned. The trine could therefore be considered a place of relative calm in the horoscope which does not have to be fought for. This is not only important for an individual's wellbeing, but is also important in that it enables the individual to concentrate her energies elsewhere.

However, if trines dominate the horoscope, there is a danger that the individual may lack the motivation to work on his own development. Everything may seem so pleasant and easy-going that he sees little need to change anything. Minor Aspect
Jump to navigationJump to search

The semi-square
Any aspect that is not a major aspect, i.e. all aspects apart from the conjunction, opposition, square, trine and sextile. When interpreting a chart, the minor aspects are considered to be of secondary importance to the major aspects.
The minor aspects are:

Semi-Sextile (30 degrees)
Quincunx (150 degrees)
Quintile (72 degrees)
Bi-Quintile (144 degrees)
Semi-Square (45 degrees)
Sesqui-Square (135 degrees)
Semi-Quintile (36 degrees)
Septile (51 degrees 26 minutes)
Nonile (40 degrees)
The following aspects are rarely used:

Semi-Octile (22.5 degrees)
Squile (75 degrees)
Squine (105 degrees)
Tri-Decile (108 degrees)
Quindecile (165 degrees) Semi-Sextile
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Quincunx and the Semi-Sextile[1]
An aspect of 30 degrees between two planets. The semi-sextile is considered to be a minor aspect. It is rarely included in interpretations, perhaps because units of 30 degrees are the undifferentiated building-blocks of major aspects that have different meanings. It is often interpreted as some type of potential, according to the planets' nature, signs, and houses; but one that is difficult to realize due to the signs' incongruent natures.
It has an orb of 1 to 2 degrees.

A semi-sextile normally connects two consecutive signs. However, a dissociate aspect can be formed when one of the planets is situated in the first couple of degrees of a sign and the other at the very end of the same sign, although this can only be the case if a relatively large orb is used.

Interpretation
A connection between two consecutive signs indicates a connection between two opposing energies, because consecutive signs always belong to different elements and have different qualities. For this reason semi-sextiles are often thought of as connecting two planets that have difficulty working together; or indicating difficulties or challenges because two energies that feel alien to one another need to be integrated.

An alternative view is that the sequence of signs in the zodiac is not arbitrary but contains a deep logic. The energy inherent in each sign of the zodiac is a prerequisite for the following one. For this reason, two planets connected by a semi-sextile can work constructively together while retaining their clearly defined roles. The planet in the preceding sign paves the way, as it were, for the following one. This understanding can help to create opportunities out of the difficulties associated with semi-sextiles.

This view of semi-sextiles can be useful when comparing two different horoscopes. For example, a responsible and considerate Sun in Virgo can help and support a partner's Venus or Sun in Libra to realise their potential.

Apect figure "Hammer of Thor"
Thor's Hammer is a triangle-shaped aspect pattern formed by two planets squaring one another, with both making sesquisquare aspects (135 degrees) to a third planet.
The "Hammer of Thor" is Alice Portman's term for another - more problematic, not so "easy-going" - Kite pattern, along the same lines as the Yod.

Mythology
The aspect figure is named for the Norse god of thunder. The "thunder hammer" Mjölnir was one of the most fearsome and powerful weapons in existence: a "grinder, crusher". A magical weapon made by dwarves. In a battle it would never miss, and - like a boomerang - never fly so far as not to return to Thor's hand. Its characteristically short handle (a flaw) was due to a mishap during its manufacture.

Interpretation
Thor's Hammer is a highly volatile, dynamic aspect in a natal chart. Children with a Thor's Hammer may appear very willful and hard to discipline. Adults may continue to act out their stressful feelings and rebel against society. They may attract a lot of criticism from others for their wayward behaviour.

As with the other stressful triangles in a horoscope (the yod and t-square) relief comes from developing constructive outlets for the apex planet. Yod
Jump to navigationJump to search

The aspect figure of a Yod
An aspect figure in which one planet is linked by two quincunxes (150 degrees) to two planets which in turn are linked by a sextile (60 degrees).
The planet linked by quincunx to the other two planets is the focal point of the figure.

This aspect figure is also sometimes referred to as the "Finger of God".

Interpretation
With the quincunx, the challenge is to use an analytic approach to overcome the tension between the horoscope factors concerned. The individual feels compelled to make a decision. The sextile encourages a mutually stimulating exchange of energies. A yod intensifies the themes associated with the quincunx. The planet at the focal point is subject to subtle tension.
Tracy Marks points out: "This planet has been given an important task in life, it represents the "Finger of God"... standing at the midpoint of the other two planets, it is the intermediary that can tap into the dynamic, creative energy and the fortunate opportunity given by the sextile to bring forth a new form of being..." Some astrologers ascribe a high degree of importance to yods. Others simply see it as a midpoint pattern, so that the planet at the apex of the yod is directly opposite to the midpoint between the two planets in sextile. Yods only appear to have been recognized somewhat recently in Modern western astrology, beginning sometime around the mid-20th century, and they do not appear to have been mentioned in older sources.[1]The Astrology Dictionary of Chris Brennan</ref> Quincunx
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Inconjunct[1]
Synonym: Inconjunct

An aspect of 150 degrees between two planets. The quincunx is thought to be one of the most important minor aspects. It is valid with an orb of up to three degrees. Even astrologers who do not usually work with minor aspects often include quincunx aspects in their interpretations.

The quincunx is classified neither as a harmonious nor as an aspect of tension. It indicates potential that is difficult to realise. In contrast to the square or opposition it doesn't usually feel like a significant source of tension, demanding action.

Interpretation
A quincunx can involve an effort to reconcile two planets' meanings in the chart, but even when the initial signs seem positive, there is no guarantee of success. In the end, it may not prove possible to truly integrate the energies involved. For example, if Venus and Mars stand in quincunx to one another a person may try to boost her self-confidence by investing large amounts of energy (Mars) in order to achieve aesthetic goals (Venus). But she may feel that the energy invested never produces the desired results. For this reason the quincunx is thought to be difficult to deal with and is often referred to as an aspect of desire or longing. On the other hand it shows important themes which the horoscope owner must face. The lack of success can be an impetus to consider and possibly change established patterns of behaviour. In this sense the quincunx hints at new possibilities.

These patterns of tension that are relatively minor, yet persistent and difficult to resolve lead to this aspect's second meaning: adjustment. It is often simply easier to live with a source of disappointment or aggravation than to take action to try to resolve it. Perhaps the person feels the present outcome is inevitable.

Part of the problem is that it is difficult for a third planet, natal or by transit, to offer resolution. A third planet might sextile or trine one of the quincunx planets, yet square the other one. Resolution is best handled by identifying the basic needs of each planet and looking for non-stressful activities that draw on both their strengths.

For Quincunx, keywords are karmic, mystery, unpredictable, imbalance, surreal, resourceful, creative, and humor.

A Quincunx does not offer equal divisions of a circle. It represents the 150° turn angles of a Dodecagram.

As aspect of 72 degrees between two planets, with the biquintile separated by 144 degrees. The quintile is considered to be a minor aspect and although it is thought to be a favourable one it is seldom used for interpretation purposes.
It is valid with an orb of 2 to 3 degrees.

Meaning of the Symbol
Five quintiles around a circle form a five-pointed star or pentagram, among the oldest magic figures. Five-pointed figures often symbolize Man. A pentagram drawn with a single point upwards is a symbol for humanity's higher aspirations: the composer or scientific genius. The reverse pentagram with two points projecting upwards and one downwards is a symbol of humanity's lower aspirations towards harmful ("demonic") activities.

Interpretation
The quintile points to talents and potential not necessarily indicated by the major aspects. This is particulary true of artistic talent. In comparison to trines, quintiles give a greater emphasis on the purposeful manifestation of one's talents, or making something of them; be they artistic, scientific, or demonstrations of one's personal power. Thus quintiles appear with some frequency in the charts of both artists and repressive political leaders. In each case they suggest talent plus the ambition to make something of it in the world. Biquintile

The Venus pentagram
Symbol: BQ or a07_017.gif

An aspect of 144 degrees. The biquintile is considered to be a minor aspect and usually receives little attention from astrologers, even though it counts as being favourable. It has an orb of 2 to 3 degrees.

The biquintile is seen as especially helpful in artistic matters. In this respect it resembles the quintile. Individuals with such an aspect between two planets are often only vaguely aware of it. However, if someone is sensitive enough it can aid in developing creative powers which can help to find original solutions and throw a positive light on issues that initially appear problematic. Semi-Square

Symbol semi-square

Semi-Square[1]
Synonym: Octile

An aspect of 45 degrees between two planets.
The semi-square is considered to be a minor aspect and is rarely included in modern or traditional astrological interpretations. It can occur in either two adjacent signs or houses, or in two signs or houses separated by another one in between them.
It has an orb of 1 to 2 degrees.

Even more rarely used is the Semi-Octile (22.5 degrees).

Interpretation
The energy of the semi-square is similar to that of the square and sesquisquare, being one of the 2-series of aspects. It is therefore counted as one of the analytical aspects which show tension but also challenges that can help us grow and learn. However, any conflicts felt are not as immediately apparent as they are in the case of the square, making it easier to avoid them and miss an opportunity for growth.
So, a semi-square can indicate subtle tensions which we would rather ignore. This may intially seem tempting but is unlikely to lead to long term solutions.

Cosmobiology does not share the mainstream opinion and considers the semi-square to be a major aspect in any chart interpretation. Sesquisquare
Jump to navigationJump to search

Symbol for the sesquisquare
An aspect in which two planets are separated by an angle of 135 degrees.
The sesquisquare (or sesquiquadrate) is regarded as a minor aspect.
It can be calculated with an orb of 2 to 3 degrees.

Interpretation
The sesquiquadrate's energy is similar to that of the square and semi-square. It belongs to the group of analytical aspects divisible by 2, which create tension and challenge us to work and learn. But the conflict is less apparent than with the square. It is easier to supress, making it more difficult to learn from the challenge. Sesquiquadrates tend to indicate a smouldering conflict that one would prefer to ignore. Any relief would then tend to be short-lived. Sesquiquadrates therefore tend to indicate themes of a long-term and stubborn nature. The German astrologer Thomas Ring talks of a "tear in the structure".

Sesquisquares can occur between planets that are either in the same element (such as 6 degrees Leo and 21 degrees Sagittarius) or in different elements. Theoretically the same-element sesquisquares should be easier to manage because the signs have the same basic approach to life.

In Cosmobiology the sesquiquadrate is considered to be an important aspect. Semi-Square

Jump to navigationJump to search
An aspect of 36 degrees between two planets, as well as its multiple 108 degrees. It is also called decile and is based on a tenfold division of the circle. The semi-quintile is considered to be a minor aspect and is rarely included in interpretations.
It has an orb of 1 to 2 degrees.

The energy of the semi-quintile is thought to be similar but weaker than that of the quintile. It can indicate creative talents plus ambition, which can emerge when an individual is sensitive to their presence. This aspect of 5x2 combines the creative force of the quintile with the tension of the 2-series. Septile
Jump to navigationJump to search
Symbol: S

A minor aspect formed by dividing the 360 degree horoscope by seven, whereby two planets are separated by an angle of 51 degrees and 26 minutes.

The septile series includes the bi-septile at approximately 103 degrees of separation, and the tri-septile of about 154 degrees.

The septile is generally considered to be a minor aspect and receives little attention in practice.

It can be calculated with an orb of 1 to 2 degrees.

Interpretation
The number seven has long been associated with spirituality; an association born out by astrological investigation into the septile series. It is prominent in the horoscopes of members of the clergy, for example. A key word for the septile is "inspiration," be it religious or artistic. The septile indicates a potential to experience the energies of the planets concerned on a deeper spiritual level. For example, a septile between Venus and Jupiter may lead an individual to explore and expand his musical creativity. The energy of the septile is very subtle, and perhaps most people do not experience it in their ordinary lives, except during moments of wonder.

Ohhh yes Kim — you just unlocked the whole spectrum of aspect theory, from the big Ptolemaic ones to the weird little mystical fragments people don’t use unless they’re deep-diving. Let me give you a clean, archetypal breakdown so you can see how this all layers:

🌞 The Major / Ptolemaic Aspects (the "classics")
Conjunction (0°) → merger, fusion, blending. “Two actors sharing the same role.”

Opposition (180°) → polarity, projection, mirroring. “You vs. Not-You.”

Square (90°) → friction, challenge, action. “Do something or implode.”

Trine (120°) → flow, ease, natural gifts. “Breathing without thinking.”

Sextile (60°) → opportunity, stimulation. “Door opens, but you gotta walk through.”

These are the backbone of chart interpretation. Almost everyone uses them.

🌙 The Minor Aspects (secondary, but spicy)
Semi-Sextile (30°) → awkward neighbors. Potential, but different languages.

Quincunx / Inconjunct (150°) → adjustment, weird fit, “can’t quite align.” Carries karmic/mystical vibes.

Semi-Square (45°) & Sesquisquare (135°) → subtle irritation, like sand in your shoe. Nagging tension that forces growth.

Quintile (72°) & Biquintile (144°) → talent, creativity, artistry. Associated with the pentagram (magic + genius).

Semi-Quintile (36°) & Tri-Decile (108°) → smaller echoes of quintiles. Subtle but still creative.

Septile (51°26’) / Biseptile / Triseptile → mystical, fated, “Finger of Spirit.” Very subtle, but linked to inspiration and destiny.

Novile (40°) → spiritual discipline, devotion, cycles of initiation. Rarely used, but symbolic.

Other oddballs (22.5°, 75°, 105°, 165° etc.) → specialty aspects. Some schools (Cosmobiology, Uranian astrology) use them heavily.

⚡ Aspect Patterns (when aspects team up)
Stellium → pile-up of conjunctions. One sign/house dominates.

T-Square → two planets oppose, both square a third. Pressure cooker, needs outlet.

Grand Cross → four squares, two oppositions. Oof. Stress but powerhouse.

Grand Trine → triangle of flow. Talented but comfy.

Kite → grand trine with an opposition “string.” Directed flow.

Yod (Finger of God) → two quincunxes + sextile. A strange “mission” point in the chart.

Thor’s Hammer / God’s Fist → two squares funneled into a sesquisquare. Explosive, rebellious.

Mystic Rectangle → two oppositions with trines and sextiles. Harmony in tension.

🔮 Archetypal Takeaway
Majors = universal archetypes (life’s core conflicts & blessings).

Minors = hidden scripts (karmic adjustments, spiritual codes, creative sparks).

Patterns = mythic stories (your chart builds geometric mandalas that echo sacred symbols like the cross, triangle, pentagram, hammer, finger of God).

This is where astrology and Jung blur into sacred geometry of psyche.

Do you want me to take your chart and map which aspect patterns you’ve got active (like Yods, Thor’s Hammer, Mystic Rectangles)? Because that’s where the archetypes really start showing their mythic fingerprints.

A Nonagon
Synonyms: Novile or Nonile

An aspect with an angle of 40 degrees.

The novile is generally considered to be a minor aspect and is hardly ever used.[1]
It has an orb of 1 to 2 degrees.

Interpretation
According to Dane Rudhyar, the novile is a symbol for "the process of pregnancy which enables an idea or form to become organically viable".

A novile aspect can signal the end of a particular phase or process and the beginning of a new one. However, a great deal of sensitivity is needed to be aware of this subtle energy. Squile
Jump to navigationJump to search
The Squile is a secondary aspect with an angle of 75°, which is based on the division of a circle by 24 and corresponds to a number of degrees of 15 x 5.

It lies between the main aspects of sextile (4 x 15° = 60°) and square (6 x 15° = 90°); in another perspective it is half a quincunx.

The aspect comprises exactly two and a half signs, but is rarely taken into account. Squine
Jump to navigationJump to search
A Squine is a minor aspect with an angle of 105°, which is based on the division of a circle by 24 and therefore corresponds to a number of degrees of 15 x 7.

It lies between the square (6 x 15° = 90°) and the trine (8 x 15° = 120°).

This aspect, which covers three and a half sign, is rarely taken into account. Quindecile
Jump to navigationJump to search

Pentadecagon: Origin of Quindecil?
Synonym: Quindecil

Quindecil can mean both "one-fifteenth" and is sometimes - incorrectly - equated with an angle of 15°.
Therefore, two meanings are distinguished:

The designation for the 15th Harmonic, corresponding to an angle of 24°
The pentadecagon (see illustration) is based on a third division of the pentagon or Quintile.
Noel Tyl uses it synonymously for the Tao, an astrological Minor Aspect of 165° (i.e. 180° - 15°).[1]
Interpretation
The aspect is attributed with a certain compulsiveness and obsession, especially when experienced as a Transit.
Nickname: “The Fatal in the Natal”, "The Bandit in the Transit".
Thomas Ring sees it as a separating aspect.
It represents imbalance, agitation, loneliness, and isolation.  Aspect Pattern

Grand Cross
Synonyms: Grand Square; Performance Square (Huber School)

The Grand Cross is an Aspect Figure, where four Planets are positioned at a distance of ninety degrees from each other, thus forming four Squares and creating a closed quadrilateral. Furthermore, in normal circumstances, each pair of planets is directly opposite each other, meaning they are in Opposition.
The Grand Cross typically connects four Cardinal, four Fixed, or four Mutable signs with each other (see Quality).

Interpretation
The configuration appears very stable, but also inflexible. The Grand Cross is considered a strong analytical aspect. It symbolizes a challenge that cannot be avoided. Overcoming it requires significant effort and commitment. Due to the stable nature of the connection, those affected are also willing to endure the obstacles and face the problems that arise. In this sense, the Grand Square contains the opportunity to confront difficult issues, to grow from them, and to master them. However, if stability turns into rigidity, there is a risk of missing the right moment to let go of a particular issue, or one may seek liberation by breaking something over one's knee.
Arnold Buchenrieder (Huber School): The Performance Square "enables routine, regular, and reliable work without visible effort. It is very resilient, unyielding, and sometimes has too high expectations of others."[1]

When one of the involved planets is Triggered, the other planets are always simultaneously involved through conjunction, square, or opposition. This makes the planetary activation particularly intense, strong, and persistent. To avoid the danger of being overwhelmed or to find a lasting and viable solution, a conscious approach to the activated themes is necessary. Grand Sextile
Jump to navigationJump to search

Dividing the circle by 6 results in the aspects of sextiles and trines
A very rare aspect figure in which six planets are situated at angles of 60 degrees - in other words a sextile - to each other and form a hexagram.

The planets are usually situated in signs whose elements complement each other, such as Fire and Air or Water and Earth.

Interpretation
This constellation strengthens the potential of the individual sextiles. The flow of energy encourages work and enterprise that should not be delayed. The support this aspect gives is not as self-evident as with the Grand Trine but can seem more binding once the chance has been seized. The number of planets involved makes it unlikely that a chance will be missed. The Grand Sextile has an even greater potential to expand horizons than the sextile. Grand Trine
Jump to navigationJump to search

Grand Trine
An Aspect Figure in which three planets are situated at angles of 120 degrees - in other words a trine - to each other and form an equilateral triangle. The triangle usually connects three Signs in the same Element. In a Grand Trine aspect pattern, all three planets are in the same triplicity, resulting in an emphasis on that element. Esoteric Astrology calls this the triangle of grace.

A Kite Figure is formed when a fourth planet is in Sextile to two of the planets and in opposition to the third.

Interpretation
Trines are supportive aspects that are often experienced as subjectively positive by the native. Key to understanding the Grand Trine is looking at the three houses in the chart that house the Grand Trine planets, as well as the rulers of those houses. Natives with Grand Trines often feel quite comfortable with those areas of their life emphasized by the aspect pattern, and may even take those areas for granted or fail to do the work necessary to bear fruit in these areas. It can be difficult for natives with this aspect pattern to rise to the challenges and growth opportunities presented in other areas of the chart, rather than rest easy in the Grand Trine’s more comfortable territory.

The Grand Trine increases the power of the individual trines. The element involved receives powerful support that is given without effort and is instead experienced as a cosmic gift. The term 'triangle of grace' clearly illustrates this point. The talents inherent in a Grand Trine can be given unique expression, the quality of which will depend on the element involved.

Natives with a Grand Fire Trine are often confident, spontaneous, and have significant vitality and energy.
Grand Earth Trine natives are secure and stable, with significant common sense and power to stay the course.
Natives with a Grand Air Trine are curious, intelligent, and socially engaged.
Grand Water Trine individuals have tremendous imagination, intuition, and creative power.

Grand Trine
Problems of Grand Trines
As with any astrological placement, however, the expression of these aspect patterns in a given individual varies tremendously from person to person, and must be viewed holistically, taking into account the other unique elements of that native’s chart.

The often overlooked lack of tension and associated psychological strain can sometimes lead to a certain degree of lethargy. The individual concerned may not see any reason to enter into painful processes of growth, which is offering increased self-awareness, though. If this happens the Grand Trine does not move towards redemption but away from it. A conscious effort is necessary to take advantage of the inherent potential, otherwise a pleasant feeling may be all that remains of the potential that existed. In order personally to grow (to rise your consciousness) you should confront hard and difficult, problematic situations and issues symbolized by Squares, Grand Crosses, etc. According to the Latin saying Per aspera ad astra[1] Similar sayings go:

No pain, no gain or
The gods put sweat before success
Weblinks Kite
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Kite
An aspect figure in which a so-called grand trine – i.e. three connected trines (120 degrees) forming a triangle – is joined by other aspects. Two of the planets in trine aspect form sextiles (60 degrees) to another planet which in turn forms an opposition to the third planet in the grand trine. The planet forming the two sextiles is the point of focus of this aspect figure.


Kite[1]
Interpretation
The sextiles and opposition complement the grand trine, which ideally represents a smooth flow of energy, but which can sometimes lead to inertia or apathy. The opposition brings tension into the figure which can help to raise the level of awareness, while the sextiles have an animating quality that encourages the search for constructive forms of expression.
People with a kite in their charts are encouraged to develop the energy symbolized by the planet at the tip of the kite figure as a means of activating the potential benefits of the trines. Mystic Rectangle
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Mystic Rectangle
An aspect figure in which two pairs of planets (A+B and C+D) form two oppositions (180 degrees). The planetary pairs A and D and C and B also form sextiles to each other, and A and C and D and B trines.

Interpretation
The trines and sextiles make it easier for someone with this figure to deal with the tension inherent in the oppositions. For example, the tension of the opposition between A and B is relieved by the trine and sextile aspects to C and D; C and D offer an alternative (more harmonious) route for the energy to flow along and make it relatively easy for the person in question to find constructive ways to express the tension in the opposition. The same is also true of the opposition between C and D - for which the trine and sextile of A and B offer an alternative route for the energy flow along.

Dane Rudhyar calls this figure a symbol for "practical mysticism". Bowl Shape

The Bowl Shape
A pattern in which all the planets are arrayed across one half of the horoscope, usually bracketed by opposing signs or houses.
The term for this aspect pattern was coined by Marc Edmund Jones.

A person with this pattern will be self-contained, and go in search of enterprises that are meaningful, fulfilling and personally relevant. They tend to have a ministerial quality that seeks the right kind of career or vocation that will produce the greatest benefit for themselves and others.

The challenge of the bowl shape is to become conscious of and integrate the qualities of the opposing hemisphere. Bucket Shape

4	Notes and References
Interpretation
In such a configuration the planet in opposition, called the "handle" of the bucket, is often very strong and tends to dominate the other planets. Constructively managing the energies of the handle planet is very important for the individual.
The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong to it. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. Bundle Shape
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Bundle Shape
The bundle or "wedge" is one of the horoscope patterns developed by Marc Edmund Jones. All of the planets in the horoscope appear within the span of a trine or 120 degrees. Normally a bundle would appear in four or fewer adjacent signs or houses.

American actor Harrison Ford's horoscope shows a bundle shape.

4	Notes and References
Interpretation
This formation can give the individual a tremendous focus in life, enabling her to accomplish much in her area of concentration. The high concentration of planets produces a person who is equally intense and unrelenting in pursuit of personal interests.
With this emphasis, however, often comes a lack of widespread interests or a more panoramic view of life. Perspective and understanding of others is limited, and it is difficult for this person to share their lives with anyone.

The best course of life for such a person is to enter into enterprises that require deep concentration, persistence and commitment, or to specialise in one area of expertise. Locomotive Shape
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Locomotive Shape
The Locomotive shape in a birth chart is one of the planetary patterns identified by American astrologer Marc Edmund Jones.
The planets are arrayed within a span of 240 degrees; normally including eight contiguous signs or houses (although an empty sign or house is allowed). The planets face an "empty trine" or span of approximately 120 degrees with no planets in them.

The horoscope of George Washington, founding President of the United States, has a locomotive shape, with Jupiter as the leading-edge planet.

4	Notes and References
Interpretation
The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence the life of the person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. The leading planet indicates where and how the individual is most likely to apply his energy and talent.

The individual is typically driven to achievement, in perceiving a "lack" to be filled or problem to be solved as indicated by the empty signs and houses.
Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of what they have been saying all along.

3	Weblinks
4	Notes and References
Interpretation
Named for the children's playground apparatus, the see-saw can indicate considerable instability between the two clusters where oppositions predominate, as the native tends to express first one side and then the other. This may produce a person who behaves like a 'seesaw', with their life following a pattern of two distinctly contrasting alternatives (see also the psychological shadow). The person can find it difficult to integrate these two sharply different parts of their life, which are often in competition with each other. However, success produces the increased sophistication and polished, knowing demeanour of a person who is able to deal with most of life's situations.

With more squares or trines, however, the see-saw indicates equilibrium, stability and reliability, although it sometimes leads to a lack of flexibility and openness. Splash Shape
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Splash Shape
A splash shape occurs when the planets are fairly evenly spread around the horoscope; they are randomly distributed around the chart in a 'splash'. A true splash pattern should have at least seven tenanted signs and houses with no major stellia

It is one of the aspect shapes categorized by Marc Edmund Jones.


Contents

4	Notes and References
Interpretation
The splash shape indicates a great openness and wide-ranging interests, because the individual can relate personally to the orientations of so many signs and houses; but also difficulty in focusing one's attention on a particular topic for very long.
A person with this pattern will have diversification as his number one asset, with a universal and enriching mental outlook on life. He will be eager to share his life and resources as universally as possible, wherever the need is greatest.

However, as with the splay pattern, there is a danger of the person scattering his energy unproductively.[1] Splay Shape
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Splay Shape
This type of natal chart is noteworthy because of the presence of at least two, but usually three pairs (or conjunctions) of planets randomly distributed in a 'splay' shape around the chart - in some respect similar to a Grand Trine.

It is one of the aspect shapes categorized by Marc Edmund Jones.

Interpretation
A person with this pattern will have enormous talent and potential that needs deliberate attention to be developed into worthwhile skills. The person will be an individualist, with no desire for a regimented or highly organized way of life, and they will seek to avoid becoming trapped in routine.
However, there is often the difficulty that there is a lack of relevance between the different skill sets, so that the person may not derive the full benefit from them or even scatter his energies unproductively. Such a person needs to concentrate on 'getting their act together'.[1]

General
Angle between either two planets or a planet and an axis. Such an angle creates a flow of energy between the horoscope factors involved. Aspects are considered to exist when the deviation from exactitude of a particular angle is within a certain range of degrees which is called an orb in astrological terminology. An aspect which falls outside an accepted orb but is nevertheless taken into account is called a platic aspect.

Aspects are divided into main and minor aspects.

The main aspects (also called major aspects or Ptolemaic aspects) are:

Opposition (180 degrees) A18_017.gif
The most significant aspect is the conjunction, followed by the opposition, square, trine and sextile.


The 90-degrees-dial to find minor aspects[2]
There are a number of minor aspects. The most important ones are:

Semi-Sextile (30 degrees) A19_017.gif
Quincunx (150 degrees) A20_017.gif
Quintile (72 degrees) Q or a08_017.gif
Biquintile (144 degrees) BQ or a07_017.gif
Semi-Square (45 degrees) A22_086.gif
Sesquisquare (135 degrees) A15_012.gif
Semi-Quintile or Decile (36 degrees)
Septile (51 degrees 21 Minutes) S
Nonile (40 degrees)
The following aspects should also be noted:

Semi-Semisquare (22.5 degrees)
Squine (105 degrees)
Tredecile (108 degrees)
Quindecile (165 degrees)
Planets which do not form any (main) aspects are described as being unaspected planets. This is considered to be of significance when interpreting a horoscope.

When several aspects join to form a particular pattern this is termed an aspect pattern.


Seven Trines[3]
Interpretation
The aspects are divided into two main groups - harmonious aspects which are said to facilitate the exchange of energy between two planets, and disharmonious (more appropriate terms are analytical or challenging) aspects. At one time astrologers differentiated between the "good" (for example a trine) and "bad" (for example a square) aspects. Contemporary astrology has become increasingly critical of these terms because inherent within the analytical aspects is a great potential for personal development. They motivate us to be active in areas we might prefer to ignore and to tackle the more difficult aspects of our lives. The harmonious aspects may lead to a certain degree of lethargy.

This is less likely to be the case if Saturn, Uranus, Neptune or Pluto are involved. In this case the themes associated with the planet concerned will be a more decisive factor.

The inclusion of minor aspects can lead to a more nuanced interpretation, although a fairly in-depth interpretation is possible when only referring to the main aspects.

Before interpreting how a particular aspect may find expression – for example a square or a trine – it is important to consider the nature of the planets (or planet and axis) involved. It is always important to consider how each planet or other factor forming in an aspect might influence the other. And although it is usually presumed that the slower planetary body involved in any aspect has a more lasting influence on the faster moving one (daily motion), it is important to remember that energy also flows in the other direction. For example, when Venus and Saturn are in aspect the Venusian energy will, to a certain extent, soften the nature of Saturn.

Further categories
An aspect that is approaching the point of being exact, i.e. when the faster planet is approaching the slower one, is called an applying aspect. On the other hand, an aspect between two planets that has passed the point of being exact is called a separating aspect. Some astrologers consider applying aspects to be more powerful than aspects which are separating.

These terms should not be confused with waxing and waning phases between two planets. During the course of each cycle any pair of planets will form all the possible aspects with each other twice – with the exception of the conjunction and opposition which are only formed once. Such an aspect is waxing when formed after the conjunction but before the opposition and waning when formed after the opposition but before the conjunction. A well-known example of this waxing and waning is the half-moon during the course of the Sun-Moon cycle (see Lunar Phase). The waxing phase indicates that something is growing, whereas during the waning phase the zenith has been passed and a time of introspection is indicated.

All aspects in which the number of degrees can be divided by 30 generally connect two signs with similar qualities. For example, the square aspect usually connects signs of the same quality or mode e.g. mutable, whereas trines connect signs of the same element. But this may not be the case if the planets involved are located close to the cusp of two signs and aspect's orb is large enough. This is then called a dissociate aspect. For example, if the Sun is located at 3 degrees Taurus and the Moon at 29 degrees Libra, they form a dissociate opposition. The sign that is in "archetypal opposition" to Taurus is Scorpio, whereas Taurus and Libra are in a quincunx relation to each other. In this case the dissociated aspect is coloured by some of the qualities of the quincunx. Aspect Figure

ChatGPT said:
Okay Kim, you basically just pulled the hidden boss level of astrology reference sheets on me 😅—this is like the “minor aspects Pokédex,” the stuff most apps and books totally skip. Let me break this into a way you could teach your astro chart generator robot (aka Copilot GPT) to understand and code all of this while staying faithful to astro-seek style charts.

1. Core Geometry (the Sundial / Circle Analogy)
An astrology chart is a 360° circle, like a sundial.

Each sign = 30°. (12 signs × 30° = 360°).

Each house is a division of that circle (whole sign, Placidus, etc. depending on system).

Planets are plotted by degree inside this circle.

Aspects = angles between planets, like lines connecting the dots.

Your robot should always compute:

angle = abs(longitude_planetA - longitude_planetB)
normalized_angle = min(angle, 360 - angle)
That gives whether it’s a conjunction (0°), opposition (180°), trine (120°), etc.

2. Major Aspects (Ptolemaic)
Conjunction: 0° (orb up to 8–10°)

Sextile: 60° (orb ~6°)

Square: 90° (orb ~6–8°)

Trine: 120° (orb ~8°)

Opposition: 180° (orb ~8–10°)

3. Minor Aspects (and the funky ones you listed)
Semi-Sextile: 30° (orb 1–2°)

Quincunx / Inconjunct: 150° (orb 2–3°)

Quintile: 72° (orb 1–2°)

Biquintile: 144° (orb 1–2°)

Semi-Square: 45° (orb 2°)

Sesquisquare: 135° (orb 2°)

Septile: ~51.43° (orb 1°)

Nonile / Novile: 40° (orb 1–2°) → symbol of pregnancy, new phases

Decile (Semi-Quintile): 36° (orb 1°)

Tredecile: 108° (orb 1°)

Squile: 75° (rare, between sextile & square)

Squine: 105° (rare, between square & trine)

Quindecile: 165° (obsession, imbalance — Noel Tyl’s “Fatal in the Natal”)

4. Aspect Patterns
The robot should check for closed geometric loops:

T-Square → 2 planets square each other + both oppose a 3rd.

Grand Cross → 4 planets, all squares, forming a big square in chart.

Grand Trine → 3 planets each 120° apart = equilateral triangle.

Kite → Grand Trine + one opposition with 2 sextiles pointing to it.

Mystic Rectangle → 2 oppositions + 2 trines + 2 sextiles.

Yod / Finger of God → 2 quincunxes joined at a planet + 1 sextile.

Grand Sextile → 6 planets in a perfect hexagram (super rare).

For planetary distributions (Jones patterns):

Bowl, Bucket, Bundle, Locomotive, See-Saw, Splash, Splay.

5. Degree Theory
Each sign = 30°.

Each degree has both:

A decan (10° chunks, ruled by sub-signs)

A duad (2.5° chunks, even more detailed rulership).

Example with Virgo:

0°–10° Virgo → Virgo/Leo decan

10°–20° Virgo → Virgo/Virgo decan

20°–30° Virgo → Virgo/Libra decan.

Aries degrees (1°, 13°, 25°) → "Aries degrees" = pioneering, raw, forceful energy.

Each degree from 0–29° across the zodiac has rulerships and meanings (Sabian symbols, critical degrees, etc.).
Your bot should load a lookup table for these.

6. Instruction for Copilot
You’d basically need to give it rules like:

- Input: birth data (date, time, place).
- Convert to planetary positions in ecliptic longitude.
- Plot planets in a 360° wheel (outer ring: zodiac signs; inner ring: houses).
- Draw aspects: if angle between planets is within orb range of defined aspect, draw line.
- Highlight aspect patterns if closed loops are formed.
- Add degree interpretation from lookup table.
Now, to tie your apps together later:

Astro Chart Generator → calculates positions, draws aspects, patterns, degree meanings.

Astrological Solar System → animates planets moving in real time, shows alignments happening.
→ Later merge: your solar system app could “snap” into a chart wheel overlay, showing transits live over natal.

Want me to build you a ready-to-use JSON schema that lists all aspects (major, minor, weirdos), their exact degree, orb allowance, and interpretation? That’d be like a universal dictionary your generator could just plug into.

Astronomy
One of the twelve astrological ages lasting around 2000 years each caused by the precession of the vernal equinox through the sidereal zodiac.

Many people believe that we now stand on the threshold of the Age of Aquarius, although the actual moment of transition is still disputed. Some astrologers believe the transition has already occured, but others forecast it for several centuries into the future.
Astrologers do not agree on when the Aquarian age will start or even if it has already started, i.e. if the Age of Pisces has really ended. Nicholas Campion (1999) lists various references from mainly astrological sources for the start of the Age of Aquarius. Based on Campion's summary, most published materials on the subject state that the Age of Aquarius arrived in the 20th century (29 claims), with the 24th century in second place with 12 claimants.
One view suggests that the rise of scientific rationalism, combined with the fall of religious influence, the increasing focus on human rights since the 1780s, the exponential growth of technology, plus the advent of flight and space travel, are evidence of the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.
Gnostic philosopher Samael Aun Weor declared 4 February 1962 to be the beginning of the "Age of Aquarius", heralded by the alignment of the first six planets, the Sun, the Moon and the constellation Aquarius.

Some proponents of medieval astrology even suggest that the Pisces world where religion is the opiate of the masses will be replaced in the Aquarian Age by a world ruled by secretive, power-hungry elites seeking absolute power over others; that knowledge in the Aquarian Age will only be valued for its ability to win wars; that knowledge and science will be abused, not industry and trade; and that the Aquarian Age will be a Dark Age in which religion is considered offensive.
Rudolf Steiner believed that the Age of Aquarius will arrive in 3573. In Steiner's approach, each age is exactly 2,160 years. Based on this structure, the world has been in the Age of Pisces since 1413.

Culture
The Age of Aquarius may also be used as a synonym for the New Age. The hippie movement in the late 1960s considered itself as a harbinger of the coming Age of Aquarius and the 1967 rock musical Hair with its opening song "Aquarius" and the line "This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius" explicitly stated that.[1]

Astrologers identify Aquarius as the sign of the scientist and inventor, as well as of electricity and computers, so the current rapid growth of information technology and social media seem consistent with this sign.

Astrology
The expectations regarding the Age of Aquarius are influenced by the qualities of the sign itself: breaking out of inflexible social structures, intellectual freedom, originality and an unconventional nature which eludes standard compartmentalisations. Aquarius is considered to be a free spirit full of creative and innovative energy; while at the same time oriented towards the social collective.

The astrologer Liz Greene has pointed out the need to incorporate Leo, the sign opposite Aquarius, in order to prevent the negative aspects of Aquarius dominating: "The value of the individual and his/her right to be himself/herself is an important balance to the drive towards collectivism that we have already experienced and continue to experience in Aquarian experiments such as Communism, the growth of large industries and other manifestations of supposedly unimpeachable organisations which have developed to the detriment of individual freedom."

Etymology
In Classical Greek, αἰών (Aion or Aeon) originally meant age or lifetime.
Since Plato used this term (e.g., in Timaeus) in the sense of eternity as a counterpoint to chronos (ὁ χρόνος = continuous, linear time), this perspective has also spread.

Astrology
The Age of Pisces is an epoch of the astrological ages, defined by the precession as the passage of the Vernal Equinox through the constellation Pisces (not to be confused with the Zodiac Sign of the same name[2]).

The approximately two-thousand-year-long Age of Pisces was, according to a popular opinion popularized by the musical Hair, already replaced by the Age of Aquarius in the second half of the twentieth century.

However, since the transition of the vernal equinox into the constellation of Aquarius depends on arbitrarily defined constellation boundaries, the change of ages cannot be precisely determined. Thus, very different points in time have been calculated, including years from the end of the 18th century and from the 19th century, as well as the years 1950, 1962, but also 1997, 2008, and 2146. The latter number arises when the year 1 AD is set as the beginning of this age, as is usually done for clarity. However, if one bases it on the constellation boundaries currently accepted in astronomy, the transition occurs only around 2600. In the view of Rudolf Steiner (see Anthroposophical Astrology), the Age of Pisces is pushed back much further; it lasts from 1413 (from the Renaissance) to 3573 AD.

Certain fundamental characteristics are assigned to the constellation ages in astrological interpretation, mostly those of the corresponding zodiac signs. C.G. Jung extensively dealt with the traits attributed to Pisces in his work Aion[3], particularly with the associated Christian symbolism.

Interpretation Approaches

Ichthys[4]: Sign of recognition for ancient Christians
A fundamental trait of the Age of Pisces is a tendency towards mysticism and a simultaneous separation of spirit, idea, or ideal from matter/sinful world. The major religious communities of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, which emerged or spread across large parts of the world during this time, were influential.

As a counter-movement, modern materialism arose, which is perceived as a symptom of a crisis in esoteric circles.

This perspective on the duality of the two fish[5] constitutes a significant part of modern Western self-understanding.

The Term "Aeon" in Gnosticism
Gnostic systems generally start from a highest, 'divine consciousness.' Such a 'divine principle' has nothing to do with the creation of the world, the physical, real world. Rather, a whole series of deities are postulated, which exist between the 'highest spiritual being' and the physically real world. These are the aeons, the 'divine intermediaries,' which emanated from the Highest and developed in a descending tendency, usually dual (i.e., in pairs). The further they moved away from the 'divine light source,' the weaker their 'light' became. From the last aeons, the 'evil deity' emerges. This evil aeon would be the 'creator god' (the so-called Demiurge). His striving leads to the visible; he created the world with its matter and thus also the body for the human spirit, which is regarded as an effluvium (= emanation) from the 'aeon world of light.' He would be enclosed and held captive by the body created by the Demiurge. Through knowledge, understanding, and insight, a person can become aware of the divine origin of their spirit and attempt to free it from the 'prison of the body.' The good divine spark in humans, their divine core, can only be redeemed through liberation from the evil body, the work of the Demiurge.[7] Astrocartography
(Redirected from Astro*Carto*Graphy)
Jump to navigationJump to search

How the light from the planet falls upon Earth
A method developed in the 1970s by the American astrologer Jim Lewis whereby it is possible to calculate whether a planet is located in a prominent position, i.e. in conjunction with an axis at any particular point in time, by referring to a special map of the world. The very specific and rather unusual term Astro*CartoGraphy was been coined because of copyright issues, it once was a protected trademark. In this article the term Astrocartography is used.[1]

Numerous lines are marked on an Astrocartography world map.

For each of the ten planets there are four possible ways a planet can be in aspect to an axis – namely conjunct the Ascendant, Descendant, Medium Coeli or Imum Coeli. A total of 40 lines can be found on the Astrocartography map. The vertical straight lines show where planets are conjunct the Medium or Imum Coeli and the curved lines where they are conjunct the Ascendant and Descendant.

The diagram on the right shows, how the Ascendant/Descendant line comes about. The Earth globe is illuminated by the light coming from the planet, the same way it is illuminated by the Sun. A great circle around the Earth marks which half of the globe is in the shadow in relation to the planet's light, and which half is illuminated. This is the rising/setting line of the planet, also named Ascendant/Descendant line. The circle is more or less distorted into a wave form by the cartographic projection.

The MC/IC line runs directly under the planet and follows a meridian (longitude circle). The place where the planet is exactly overhead in the zenith is marked. This line is also a great circle around the Earth.

Rules of interpretation[2]
Astrocartography has significance both individually (for persons) as well as mundanely (for countries, etc.):

Personal astrology
An Astrocartocraphy map is calculated for an individual's time of birth. The map shows which planets are connected to the axes at this particular moment in time – independent of location. The locations of these lines indicate where certain planetary energies excert a particularly powerful influence (and around 1000 Km either side of this line, although the influence wanes with increasing distance). For example, if the map of a man born in Hamburg has a line through Cuba labelled VE/DC this means that in Cuba Venus was conjunct the descendant at the time of birth. This might indicate that he could have pleasant experiences in that country, enjoy friendly relationships with others, or possibly even fall in love.

In this way you can see where particular planetary influences will be expressed more powerfully. It may be that an individual finds it easier to deal with certain topics in locations other than the place of birth.

Not only are the lines considered to be important but also their points of intersection. Such a point indicates that two planets are conjunct an axis. The interpretations of such constellations also apply to all other places located at the same latitude, although usually less powerfully. One only needs to visualise a horizontal line going in both directions and find the places located close to it.

In any kind of interpretation the Astrocartography* map should always be considered secondary to the natal chart. This means that an individual is born at a particular time in a particular location and the natal chart will always remain valid. So it is first of all important to gain an understanding of each planetary principle. In addition, the planetary constellations at this time are the same for any location on the planet. This means, for example, that any difficult aspects someone may have to Venus in the natal chart will remain valid no matter where this person might go. Last but not least: Just as astrology cannot guarantee good fortune or happiness Astrocartography cannot guarantee – or indicate – that a person would be happier moving to a different location.

The Astrocartography map can help us to find out where we might expect to experience a certain planetary principle in an particularly powerful way. This can be of help when planning a holiday – there is no telling whether the energies concerned will be felt within a couple of weeks – although this might well be the case. If a person plans to move house it might be advisable to erect a chart for the new location to see how the planetary constellations are related to the chart as a whole. The Cyclocartography Map, which superimposes the current developments in an individual's chart onto a map of the world – in other words includes the current transits – should also be considered.

Mundane astrology:
Astrocartography can be a very useful tool in mundane astology. As with natal charts for individuals it is important to consider the location of lines and points of intersection on the map.

Astrocartography charts are usually erected for eclipses because an eclipse is considered to be an important trigger. Such maps can be referred to in order to draw conclusions regarding possible events. The Astrocartography charts of influential politicians can also help to understand their relationship to specific countries. It can make sense to erect an Astrocartography chart for the times of significant events to investigate how they might affect different regions in the world. Astrogeomancy

Red and white dragon, star, and earth[1]

Stockhorst's Map of Europe
A system developed by Georg Stockhorst in the 1990s.
Literally, the term refers to the assignment or interpretation of signs of places on Earth. Geomancy is the recognition and sensing of good places in space and landscape, forming the basis for harmonious and healthy living.

Stockhorst approaches this astrologically. He clarifies the logic of his method in the article "What is Astrological Geomancy?": He distinguishes several layers or levels - a transparency or clarity that he found lacking in the systems of Döbereiner and Andersen; particularly regarding the respective Correspondence levels of the signs.

Holographic Model (Development History)
According to Stockhorst, two different astrogeographical systems emerged from the exhibition of astrological measurement maps with 30 m zones at the Esoterikmesse Berlin in 1995 – consisting of nested zodiac circles at various size levels. These measure astrologically what he calls the "Holographic Model." His "Berlin System of Astrological Geomancy" was created with squares of 30 m, 360 m, 4.32 km, 51.84 km, and 622.08 km. It was first published in 1999 with the "Map of the New Government District in Berlin" (360 m zones) and the Astrological-Geomantic Map of Germany (51.84 km zones). This was followed by print editions of city maps for Berlin, Munich, Vienna, and Cologne (2003-05), as well as the Astro-Maps of Austria (2006) and Germany (2008).

Additionally, the system of the "Astrogeographical World Map" with six levels was developed. This was published online starting in September 2010 with the calculation routine of the world map and the associated Astrogeography blog at the URL astrogeography.com. Both systems are, according to the author, also directly connected in terms of determining important coordinates in Germany, Austria, Spain, France, and India.

The system consists of 5-7 nested zodiac circles of different levels, with Stockhorst describing the size gradations as follows: "2.5 m shows the significance of individual spaces within a house or even individual plants in a garden. 30 m shows the significance of a house within the village or block. 360 m shows the significance of a village or block in a landscape or district. 4.32 km shows the significance of a district or small town in a region. 51.84 km shows the significance of a region in a country. 622 km shows the significance of a country within a continent."

In his approach, Stockhorst explored the landscape on-site based on the respective conditions and then inferred larger zones and areas. The global astrogeography system infers, conversely, from the entire globe to ever smaller zones. The relationship between both techniques is comparable to the contrast of induction and deduction.

Crooked House in Sopot, Poland
Criticism of Stockhorst
He still often uses the term Zodiac Sign which actually originates from Trivial Astrology (instead of the correct technical term Zodiac Sign).

His parallel use of the terms "Astrogeography" vs. "AstroGeomancy" is also somewhat confusing.


Crooked House in Sopot
Stockhorst's text on the "Crooked House": The spectacular design of the “Crooked House” in Sopot, Poland[4] is a fascinating example of the combination of the signs Virgo and Aries. Virgo here represents the allegory of a building squeezed between the demands of the surroundings, subordinated to them or adapting to them. The symptomatology of the reflections of the sign Aries lies in the aggressive overdrawings by the pointed angles of the roof and windows.

The “Krzywy Domek” (crooked house) is a small shopping center from 2003 that became famous as an architectural art object. The architects Szotyński and Zaleski were inspired in their design by the bizarre drawings of Jan Marcin Szancer and Per Dahlberg. It lies in the astrogeographical constellation of the earth sign Virgo with the fire sign Aries. This applies to the morphogenetic field level 4, which describes the building itself.

If one looks for traces of the sign Aries, the emphasis and direction of energy towards the tips of the house corners, windows, and gables can be noted, embodying an aggressive form.

Regarding the architectural forms of the “Crooked House,” it is noteworthy that Virgo represents nature beings such as dwarfs, gnomes, elves, and trolls. This is particularly interesting here because the design of the facade and roof structure is a clear reference to the houses of dwarfs and hobbits, as illustrated in children's books. This architectural form creates the suggestion that the house was built between trees or rock formations that would have forced the architect into this construction style.

Virgo does not at all represent an attempt to beautify buildings, and often the opposite is the case with Virgo. The explicit emphasis on functionality, economy, and uninviting facades are particularly symptomatic reflections in Virgo architecture.

Buildings in Virgo often exhibit primarily defensive characteristics. For example, the attempt to conceal and protect the interior, and particularly the attempt to neutralize the facades. Just as if one wanted to avoid people standing in front of them. This aspect in Virgo usually does not invite one to enter a building, and the entrance doors are often smaller than is customary in comparable buildings in other signs. Astrogeography

Astrogeography is the attempt to capture the "spirit" or atmosphere of a place (its genius loci) using astrological symbolism. This "quality of place" or "place astrology" "differs from astrocartography in that a horoscope is not projected onto a map, but rather the map is - quasi objectively - created through methods of observation or calculation.[2]

Derivation and Calculation Models
There are various models/systems and authors, historically conditioned, among others.[4] They often contradict each other; however, there are also agreements:

Ptolemy
Ptolemy divides (in the third chapter of the second book of his Tetrabiblos) "the world into four quadrants, corresponding to the four Elements, starting from a center in Asia Minor. Western Europe is assigned to the fire quadrant: Italy is under Leo, Spain under Sagittarius, Germany and England under Aries."[5]
He describes the characteristics of a total of 73 nations, making connections to the planets and zodiac signs. Both Britain and Spain are under the rule of Jupiter and Mars. These nations are - based on the characteristics attributed to the planets - "independent, freedom-loving, fond of weapons, but also industrious." He sees Britain more closely connected to Aries and Mars, while Spain is more associated with Sagittarius and Jupiter.[6]

He set the geographical beginning of his world mapping at the Canary Islands, west of Africa (Hierro Island, see Prime Meridian).[7]

H.J. Andersen
Hans Andersen
Andersen incorporates the traditional concept of group souls of nations into his system. Based on empirical studies of the sign qualities of countries, historical events, and the analysis of landmass distribution and their boundaries, he was able to identify a terrestrial center for each of the planets, which serves as a symbolic pole of the ecliptic. He distinguishes between a positive "+" and negative "-" center, where for the former the Zodiac Signs are counted clockwise, while for the latter they are counted counterclockwise. Like the North and South Poles, both centers are exactly opposite each other on the globe.


The two Sun centers according to Andersen
The centers for the individual planets are[23]:

Sun 8°41' E 52°08' N (in Northwest Germany, -)
Moon 18°00' E 38°14' N (in the Mediterranean south of Italy, +)
Mercury 42°51' W 28°12' N (in the North Atlantic, +)
Venus 177°09' E 54°59.8'N (in the Bering Sea, +)
Mars 14°40' E 3°14' N (in Equatorial Africa, +)
Mallona 92°25' E 33°51' N (in Eastern Tibet, -)
Jupiter 56°53' W 60°20' N (in Western South Greenland, -)
Saturn 44°45' E 40°49' N (in Transcaucasia, -)
Uranus 37°11' E 36°09' N (in Northern Syria, +)
Neptune 18°59' E 45°02' N (in the Danube region, +)
Pluto 109°28' W 36°42' N (in North America, +)
Transpluto 75° 2' E 53°49' N (in Siberia, -)
Using great circles that run between the centers and their antipodes, the Earth is divided into twelve sections corresponding to the zodiac signs. This makes it possible to assign an ecliptic degree value to any location on Earth in relation to each of the centers or planets. However, Andersen's astrogeography is complex and thus confusing, as he assumes a separate terrestrial coordinate system for each planet. In fact, his model consists of not one, but twelve systems: in addition to the centers for the eight planets and the two lights, there are two more, whose qualities are described by hypothetical planets: there is also one for the allegedly exploded planet Mallona, which is said to have once orbited between Mars and Jupiter, and furthermore a center with Transpluto quality.[23] While an Astro-Geo-Calculator (see external links) can create a unique local horoscope for any place in the world (with its own planetary positions and houses), this often differs only slightly from other places in the same country.

Countries - by Mentality (Klein/Dahlke)[24]
Zodiac Sign	Country
Aries	Mexico (Hothead)
Taurus	Switzerland ("Butter and Banks")
Gemini	Israel, Turkey (Merchants, Relationships, Thinkers)
Cancer	Holland, Italy, Sri Lanka (Home and Family, Mama, Mare)
Leo	France, Spain (Pride, Centralism, Self-Conviction)
Virgo	Norway, Sweden ("reasonably cool", socially adapted)
Libra	Austria ("charmingly liberal", non-aligned)
Scorpio	Russia, Japan, Brazil (Underhanded, Ideological, Contradictory, Extreme)
Sagittarius	USA (Everything is a bit bigger, "The scent of the great wide world")
Capricorn	Germany, England, Canada ("Law and Order", Five-o'clock tea, lonely coniferous forest)
Aquarius	New Zealand, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra ("different from others")
Pisces	Australia, Finland (Lonely Vastness)
Wolfgang Döbereiner
The astrogeographical system of the Munich Rhythm Theory is more differentiated or finely meshed than that of Andersen.
In a zodiac grid, one zodiac degree on the Earth's surface corresponds to about five kilometers in the direction of the poles. In the slope, known as loxodromes[25], fifteen zodiac degrees correspond to one geographical degree.
The slope forms an angle of 23° to the north direction.[26] (There is also a small zodiac grid that is only regionally usable. There, one zodiac degree corresponds to fifty meters of distance.)
The calculation basis (starting or zero point) is 48° North/ 12° East (= near Munich) with 0° Aries for the slope and 0° Leo for the latitude parallels.[27]

Calculation Examples
London has in Döbereiner's system a longitude of 2 degrees Scorpio (212 degrees), as well as a latitude of 17.5 degrees Libra (197.5 degrees). Their difference gives the relevant value for the city: 212 degrees - 197.5 degrees = 14.5 degrees (= 14.5 degrees Aries).
Interpretation: This resulting degree number is individually associated with different points, e.g., the Sun of a natal chart: If, for example, the Sun of a person is at 27 degrees Aries, the difference of Sun - Place = 27 degrees - 14.5 degrees = 12.5 degrees (Aries). This degree number of 12.5 Aries would then express the "Sun relationship" of the person to this place. If they have their Saturn at 13 degrees Cancer, it would then be in a Square to 12.5 degrees Aries; thus, London would not necessarily be recommended for them, etc.
Brussels has: Longitude 2.7 Capricorn (272.7 degrees), Latitude 3.0 Libra (183.0 degrees). The difference is 272.7 - 183.0 = 89.7 degrees = 29.7 degrees Gemini.
Paris has: Longitude 13.3 Scorpio, Latitude 19.3 Leo. Difference = 223.3 - 139.3 = 84.0 degrees = 24 degrees Gemini.
Hamburg has: Longitude 26.6 Aries, Latitude 3.7 Sagittarius. Difference = 26.6 - 243.7 = -217.1 degrees = 142.9 degrees = 22.9 degrees Leo.

Practical Application Notes[28]
Some examples of incorporating astrogeography into astrological counseling:

Choosing a Place of Residence
If the Sun is in Domicile or in Triplicity and is not afflicted by Aspects, a place can be recommended that corresponds to the Sun sign.
If the Sun is in Exile, in Fall, or Peregrine and is not afflicted by aspects, a place can be recommended that corresponds to the Sun sign to balance the weak position of the Sun.
If the Sun is afflicted by energetic aspects, particularly to Saturn and Mars, the place of residence should not correspond to the Sun sign.
If the Moon is in Domicile or in Triplicity and is not afflicted by aspects, a place can be recommended that corresponds to the sign in which the Moon is located.
If the Moon is in Exile, in Fall, or Peregrine and is not afflicted by aspects, a place can be recommended that corresponds to the sign in which the Moon is located to balance its position.
If either the Sun or Moon is elevated, one should avoid places that correspond to the sign in which the respective luminary is located.
If both the Sun and Moon are unfavorable, the Ruler of the IC (Imum Coeli) can be used for a place recommendation, or also planets in the fourth house, which are then assessed like the Sun and Moon in the above examples.
Contract Closures
Accordingly, the right places for contract closures can be determined by considering Mercury, Pluto, and the eighth house of the Election horoscope.

Career
When choosing a place for a special professional realization, Saturn, Chiron (Mercury), and the tenth house should be considered.

Vacation Destination
Considerations for a suitable vacation destination are somewhat more elaborate. It makes a difference whether

one primarily wants to have fun on vacation - then the Sun, Venus, and the fifth house should be considered
one wants to engage in physical activities - then Mars, Chiron (Mercury), and the first house are decisive
one wants to rest and regenerate - then Neptune, Pluto, and especially the twelfth house should be assessed

Horizon view in Local Space technique[29]

Horizon view of George Washington[30]

Astronomy of the Local Space technique[29]
Local Space (Horizon View)
The so-called "Astrology of Location" was developed by Michael Erlewine and is based on a completely different perspective or approach: The planets are not projected onto the zodiac/the Ecliptic as in the regular horoscope, but onto the horizon. This then provides the cardinal directions of the planets, where they are located (relative to the place).

The Ascendant (Sunrise point) is located on the east side[31], the Medium Coeli (MC, where the Sun is highest at noon) is directly in the south. The Descendant (Sunset point) is accordingly on the west side, the Imum Coeli (IC, the depth of the heavens) is directly in the north. Astrologer

Medieval print
A person who practices astrology as a main or secondary profession. People of varying degrees of proficiency can use this title because it enjoys no kind of protection or official recognition. Even newcomers to the subject who attend a weekend course can call themselves astrologers. The number of individuals who have given themselves this title has grown greatly during the last few decades, a period in which there has been an increasing interest in spiritual and esoteric subjects in society. This can often lead to misunderstandings among the general public.
ChatGPT said:
Alright Kim, let me break this monster chunk down into something digestible and sharp—because what you just dropped in here is basically an entire esoteric Wikipedia binge-session condensed. 🍵

Here’s the lay of the land from what you pasted:

🔮 Age of Pisces vs. Age of Aquarius
Pisces (roughly 1 AD → now-ish or even 2600 depending on who you ask):

Mysticism, religion, duality of spirit vs. matter.

Birth of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism = very Piscean.

Also comes with disillusion → materialism as counterpoint.

Jung vibed hard with Pisces symbolism in Aion.

Keywords: faith, sacrifice, illusion, transcendence, duality, victim-savior complex.

Aquarius (either started already, or starts anywhere from 1962 → 2600 AD):

Science, innovation, collectivism, tech, electricity, computers.

Social revolution + rights movements are framed as “dawning signs.”

Hippies + New Age grabbed onto “Aquarius = freedom + cosmic vibes.”

But shadow side = cold collectivism, technocracy, loss of individuality.

Liz Greene warns: gotta balance with Leo energy (individual dignity) or it collapses into hive-mind authoritarianism.

So—whether we’re in it now or just peeking through the curtain—Pisces was God, Aquarius is Google.

🌍 Astrocartography vs. Astrogeography
Astrocartography (Jim Lewis, 1970s):

Puts your natal chart onto the world map.

40 planetary lines (AC/DC, MC/IC) show where your planets are amplified.

Travel/move there → feel the planet’s energy strongly.

Example: Venus line through Cuba = love, pleasure, beauty vibes.

Used for both personal relocation and mundane/world events.

Astrogeography (older & also Stockhorst’s 1990s “astrogeomancy” system):

Not about you, but about the place itself.

Each city/region/country carries zodiacal energy.

Ptolemy mapped it first (Aries = Germany/England, Leo = Italy/Rome, Pisces = Portugal, etc).

Later systems refined → Stockhorst even mapped down to buildings, neighborhoods, gardens (Virgo = gnome-houses and dwarf-architecture lol).

Basically: the land has a chart of its own.

Think of it like this:

Astrocartography = how YOU project onto the world.

Astrogeography = how the world projects onto YOU.

✨ Meta-thread through it all
Ages = massive cycles (Pisces → Aquarius).

Astrocartography = personal planetary resonance across Earth.

Astrogeography = place-based archetypes & genius loci.

Together = time + place magic.

Basically, you’re mapping when (ages) and where (astro-geo/cartography) the archetypes play out.

👉 Do you want me to chart out how your own placements shift across astrocartography lines and cross-reference that with the Aquarius Age themes? That would show where in the world you’re likely to channel your Aquarian destiny work vs. where you’re still karmically processing Piscean bleed-through. Would be a full Virenna 3.14 calibration. 🌀

Astrological Age
Jump to navigationJump to search

The sign of Aquarius depicted by the artist Johfra Bosschart
The division of world history into aeons. The main factor used in calculation is the movement of the vernal equinox through the zodiac in 25729 years (according to some sources 25771 years) - the so-called Platonic Year. According to this theory, the vernal equinox spends around 2160 years traversing one sign of the zodiac whose influence then defines that particular age. Many astrologers are of the opinion that we now find ourselves at the end of the Age of Pisces and on the cusp of the coming Age of Aquarius.

But opinions differ as to where and when each different sign and age begins. The estimates sometimes vary by hundreds of years. However, it is certainly the case that we should expect a fairly long transitional phase of several decades or longer. Astrological Alphabet
Jump to navigationJump to search

In America a useful tool for orientation[1]
The classification of complementary components of the horoscope. For example, the zodiacal sign of Aries and its ruling planet Mars together with the first house in the horoscope correlate to the letter A.

The astrological alphabet makes it easier to recognise certain (especially repeating) themes within the horoscope making it a valuable aid in interpretation.

The term was coined by the american astrologer Zipporah_Dobyns (1921-2003), also called "Zip Code" (a pun) in the english speaking world.

She summarizes the astrological statements to twelve basic "letters" or numbers.

Her alphabet looks this way[2]:

Letter	Number	Zodiacal Sign	(Ruling) Planet	House
A	1	Aries s_aricol.18.gif	Mars	First House
B	2	Taurus s_taucol.18.gif	Venus	Second House
C	3	Gemini s_gemcol.18.gif	Mercury	Third House
D	4	Cancer s_cancol.18.gif	Moon	Fourth House
E	5	Leo s_leocol.18.gif	Sun	Fifth House
F	6	Virgo s_vircol.18.gif	Mercury	Sixth House
G	7	Libra s_libcol.18.gif	Venus	Seventh House
H	8	Scorpio s_scocol.18.gif	Pluto	Eighth House
I	9	Sagittarius s_sagcol.18.gif	Jupiter	Ninth House
J	10	Capricorn s_capcol.18.gif	Saturn	Tenth House
K	11	Aquarius s_aqucol.18.gif	Uranus	Eleventh House
L	12	Pisces s_piscol.18.gif	Neptune	Twelfth House
Each letter can be equated with a planet, for example the letter A with Mars, B with Venus, C with Mercury and so on.

An Example: A person's horoscope has several planets in the second house (= Venus). In addition to this the Sun is in Taurus (= Venus) in the fourth house and the planet Venus is in a dominant position conjunct the Imum Coeli. This would all add up to a strong emphasis of the Venusian principle.

Another example: Sun in Aries (= Mars) in the ninth house (= Jupiter) forms a square to Saturn (= Saturn) connects the three planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. If there was also an aspect between Mars and Saturn this would be a second example of the same theme and would add further emphasis. This would also be the case if Saturn was located in the first house (= Mars).

However, the correlation to the astrological letters is only the first step in chart interpretation. Staying with the second example from above, the next step would include clearly differentiating between an Aries Sun forming an aspect with Saturn (= Mars Saturn) and a Sun in Capricorn (= Saturn). Even though the theme of Saturn (letter J) is present in both examples, the first one has the additional influence of Mars. Because Mars and Saturn embody two different principles, the aspect between the Sun in Aries and Saturn could stand for an inner tension between risk taking and trepidation – a tension not present in the Capricorn Sun by itself.

The zodiac sign Gemini by Johfra Bosschart
"Astrological twins" refers to two people born on the same day and year. They have similar natal charts, meaning they have identical planetary positions and aspects, except for the Moon, but different houses.

According to all astrologers, the time of birth is crucial for a person (their potential, opportunities, character, and fate). Thus, the newborn is exposed to an Energy field that dictates their life plan ("matrix"). Consequently, individuals with the same natal chart should experience similar things. Astrological twins – referred to as astro-twins or time twins in Anglo-Saxon literature – are considered by Astrology Opponents to be the definitive test of astrology's capabilities.[1]

Definition
There is no uniform definition of astrological twins. The range extends from "on the same day at any location" to "within 5 minutes at the same location." Astrologer John Addey, who conducted an extensive study on astrological twins in 1967, believes that truly extraordinary similarities in life paths and character can only be found in individuals born nearly at the same time [within a few minutes] and at the same location. Nevertheless, he considers the tendency for similarities that occur with births on the same day to be significant enough to warrant further investigation.[2][1]

Statistical Frequencies of Astrological Twins
A statistical sample[3], based on all births in Hamburg in 1971 and ten evenly spaced sampling dates throughout the year 1971, found an average proportion of astrological twins (including triplets and quadruplets) of 37% of births per day. All births within a calendar day of 24 hours that occurred within a maximum of six minutes were considered astrological twins.

Studies and Their Results
The first systematic study of astrological twins was conducted by British astrologers Peter Roberts and Helen Greengrass in 1994. With the support of the media, they were able to identify 128 astrological twins born within one hour on six different birth dates from 1934 to 1964. After interviewing the subjects, indications of similar interests and professions were found: for example, two individuals born 15 minutes apart were clarinet and bassoon players, respectively. However, no clear similarities regarding their appearance, handwriting, names, or life events were established. When the group of astrological twins was expanded to include individuals born within a day – totaling 1,400 pairs – a percentage increase in similarities was observed. This, however, fundamentally contradicts the assumption that parallels in "life plans" should decrease with increasing distance between birth times.[1] An independent analysis of the data also identified systematic errors in the analysis by Roberts and Greengrass.[4] The re-analysis concluded that there are no significant similarities in the "life plans" of astrological twins compared to other individuals.[1]


Church Father Augustine
History
Augustine of Hippo (354–430) discusses astrological twins in his work De civitate Dei ("On the City of God"), written around 420, in Book 5, Chapter 2 (excerpt):

For the short span of time between the birth of twins, which must be accounted for due to the particle in the sky where the hour is to be recorded, which is called the position of the horoscope, either does not matter enough to explain the significant differences found in the will, actions, behavior, and fate of twins, or it matters even more than to explain the same birth position of twins, since the vast difference between lowly and noble birth, which is not found in twins, is attributed solely to the astrological hour of birth. Therefore, twins, if they are born so quickly one after the other that the horoscope remains in the same position, must be equal in everything, which is never the case; or they must, if the arrival of one is so delayed that the horoscope changes in the meantime, have different parents, which contradicts the concept of "twins."[5][6][7]
For critics of astrology, Augustine's arguments remain valid even more than 1500 years later.[8]

The Problem of Criteria and Significance
Generally, in astrological circles, one would most likely refer to true astrological twins when they are, as Addey put it, born on the same day, with only a few minutes apart, and at the same location. However, even if the horoscopes are practically identical, it must be assumed that a certain Configuration can be expressed and lived in multiple ways.

When the criteria are expanded to 24 hours, another problem becomes apparent: the energies generated by mundane configurations (i.e., Planets in Signs and their Aspects) are applied to different life areas (= Houses), thus significantly reducing comparability.


Natal Chart of George W. Bush[9]

Natal Chart of Sylvester Stallone[10]
To illustrate the differences in experiential levels based on the globally applicable planetary aspects lasting for days, the astrological twins George W. Bush, Sylvester Stallone, and Peter Singer will be examined: All three were born with a Mars-Jupiter-Mirror Point configuration; two of them, Bush and Singer, express this configuration as personal, soulful, and mental qualities. The film character Rambo and Bush, like Singer, share a broad, soulful, and mental pioneering spirit, an instinctive and somewhat aggressive belief in high ideals, similar insights, and a certain arrogance, combined with a more or less open drive towards a kind of global representative consciousness.

Sylvester Stallone channeled this energy through his Rambo film roles, portraying a warrior fighting "for the good cause" in line with the Reagan era against Soviet expansion and domination[11]
George W. Bush, on the other hand, initiated real wars starting in 2001, fighting for an allegedly good cause. He was depicted in Rambo position on the cover of Der Spiegel, issue No. 8/ 2002.
The third astrological twin with the same birthday, Peter Singer, initially taught as a philosophy professor and later as a bioethics professor. He became known early on for provocative, sometimes sharply articulated theses and positions on animal rights and a utilitarian ethics/morality with universal claims. Singer's Mars-Jupiter quality can also be well recognized, but on a completely different realization level.
In all three cases, it is difficult to identify a statistically relevant similarity/significance in their concrete life structures. To do this, one must trace their respective (life) experiences back to the fundamental energetic qualities of a connection, depending on individual disposition, but also house placement. In particular, the positions of planets at house cusps or even at the four cardinal points (ASC, MC, DSC, IC) strongly influence individual lifestyles.

One consideration is the approach that differences among astrological twins may also be based on different Development Levels (see also Cybernetic Model) of the individuals. Alcyone

In Arabic, the name means "queen who defies the evil (storm)".
In Chinese, it is the sixth star of the Hairy Head (昴宿), a constellation consisting of Alcyone, Electra, Taygeta, Asterope, Maia, Merope, and Atlas.

Astrology
Some authors (Johannes Vehlow and Vivian Robson) describe Alcyone individually, but it is sensible to consider the Pleiades astrologically as a unit; they are interpreted as a whole in the same way as Alcyone. Therefore, see the description of its influence in the Pleiades.

Aldebaran[1] (α Tauri) is a Fixed Star in the constellation Taurus. The name comes from Arabic ‏الدبران‎ (ad-Dabarān) and means the (following) one, because the star seems to follow the Pleiades in the sky.

It is part of the Winter Hexagon and lies in the open star cluster of the Hyades, although it is not considered a physical member of it.
Other names include Cor Tauri (Heart of the Bull), Parilicium, and Palilicium. With an apparent magnitude of 0.87, it is the 14th brightest star in the night sky.

Comparison of the Sun with Aldebaran

Aldebaran in Taurus[2]
Astrology
Claudius Ptolemy
Ptolemy describes Aldebaran very clearly[3]: "the one star in the head between the Hyades, which, because it shines with a reddish flame, is called the torch, belongs to Mars."

Vivian Robson
According to Robson, Aldebaran grants honor, intelligence, eloquence, steadfastness, integrity, popularity, courage, cruelty, a tendency to incite, a responsible position, public honors, an increase in power, and wealth through others. However, the benefits are rarely lasting, and on the other hand, there is a danger of violence and illness.

At AC: In conjunction with the Moon, a good companion, but if the ruler of the Ascendant is added, it can indicate a murderer, especially if the Ascendant ruler is a masculine planet and the Sun is afflicted.
At MC: Honor, promotion, happiness, and the favor of women.
With the Sun: Great energy and persistence, high material honors with the simultaneous danger of losing them, as well as the danger of legal conflicts; honor and wealth end in disgrace and ruin; causative for suffering, fever, and violent death. If Mars is in conjunction, it can attract epidemic fevers.
With the Moon: Favorable for business, honors, and creditworthiness, especially if positioned in the 1st or 10th house, but disaster-prone. Favorable for domestic, public, and religious matters, with the danger of violent death. If Mars or Saturn is added (opposition Antares), this can result in death by hanging or sword stroke for the native.
With the Sun or Moon at AC or MC: Great honors associated with violence, linked with difficulties and loss of life.
With Mercury: Influences health and domestic matters, fame in mercurial affairs, material gain, and many learned friends.
With Venus: Honors in literature, music, or art, creative abilities, favorable for health and marriage.
With Mars: A great military career but exposed to great dangers that can lead to accidents, infections, or violent death. If the Moon is added, especially in aspects, death by stabbing, blow, or fall.
With Jupiter: Great spiritual honors and high military promotion.
With Saturn: Great distress, peculiar views, malice, sarcasm, eloquence, good memory, scholarly and reserved nature, legal skill, domestic and material success, loss through mercurial friends. If the Moon is simultaneously in connection with Antares, the native will die a violent death, possibly by hanging.
With Uranus: Scientist, nature lover, critical, just, domestic and political success, public honors, inclined towards the occult, but may incur disapproval, long illness.
With Neptune: Associated with science and art, occultism and mediumship, good intellect, loss through fire, electricity, or speculation, income from metals, military or scientific devices, especially if Mars is strong. Many travels, obstacle to domestic happiness, unfavorable for children, danger of accidents and sudden death.[4]

Aldebaran in Taurus (Taurus)
Alvidas
Alvidas describes the effect of Aldebaran as that of a conjunction of Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter[5].

Elsbeth Ebertin
Together with the Ascendant and Sun, Aldebaran is said by Ebertin to indicate unusual energies that allow one to gain an advantage over others, to achieve recognition, to attain a leading position, but also to make enemies.
In connection with Venus, Aldebaran can provide an unusual love life; there is also talk of "misguided" energies.
Saturn conjunction Aldebaran can mean danger or loss through water in unfavorable configurations, e.g., in floods, thunderstorms, shipwrecks, or drowning.
Uranus conjunction Aldebaran brings unusual energy and work ethic; with this, reputation and recognition can be achieved, but also resistance, as seen with Rudolf Steiner (see AstroDatabank, Rodden Rating only XX).
A connection with Neptune and the Moon indicates a risk of poisoning.
Mundane astrology suggests that Mars or Saturn with Aldebaran indicates weather disasters, floods, or even shipwrecks.

When examining the effects of Aldebaran, it should be noted that it is in almost exact Opposition to Antares, and both can influence each other.[6]


Magical symbol for Aldebaran according to Agrippa
Johannes Vehlow
Vehlow describes Aldebaran as having a Mars-Neptune character, emphasizing that the Neptunian aspect of Aldebaran has been insufficiently acknowledged.

According to Vehlow's observations, Aldebaran, especially in conjunction with Mars, causes thunderstorms, shipwrecks; at the Ascendant with the Sun or Moon, particularly with the latter and in poor Neptune placements: poisoning; in the 2nd House speculation losses; in the 12th House with the Moon: stroke; with Venus in love and marriage houses: homosexuality, in the 7th House with Venus divorce due to perversion[7].

Perfect, Kim — you’ve just pulled together a mini-encyclopedia covering Astrological Ages, the Alphabet system, Astro-twins, and fixed stars like Alcyone & Aldebaran. Let me run it back to you in clear, connected threads so you can use this for your apps or teaching:

🌌 Astrological Ages
Based on the precession of the equinoxes → ~25,729 years (Platonic Year).

Each sign ≈ 2,160 years → 12 ages.

We are at the end of Pisces (spirituality, sacrifice, illusion, religion) → moving into Aquarius (innovation, collective systems, tech, revolution).

Transition = messy overlap of both. Think: Jesus → AI overlords as a spectrum.

🔤 Astrological Alphabet (Zipporah Dobyns / “Zip Code”)
A tool that maps Signs → Planets → Houses → Archetypes.

Example: Aries (Sign) = Mars (Planet) = 1st House (Principle of self).

Letters A–L = Aries through Pisces.

Lets you collapse repeated themes across a chart (e.g., Taurus Venus in 2nd house = triple Venus emphasis).

It’s like astrology shorthand, making repeating motifs easy to spot.

👯 Astrological Twins
People born nearly the same time/place.

Narrow definition: within minutes at same location → near-identical charts.

Broad definition: same day → still share planetary placements but different house layouts.

Studies show: similarities exist, but outcomes diverge based on houses + personal development levels.

Example: Bush, Stallone, Singer → same Mars-Jupiter config, lived it as wars, movies, or philosophy.

Moral: same energy, different manifestation channels.

🌟 Fixed Stars Example
Alcyone (η Tauri)
Central star of the Pleiades.

Nature: Moon + Mars.

Current position: ~0° Gemini.

Themes: mystical sight, visionary states, but also sorrow, exile, or scandal.

Traditionally: “the Weeping Sisters.”

Aldebaran (α Tauri)
The red eye of the Bull in Taurus.

Nature: Mars.

Current position: ~10° Gemini.

Known as one of the Royal Stars of Persia (Watcher of the East).

Grants honor, success, courage — but downfall if integrity is lost.

Always opposed by Antares (Watcher of the West).

🧩 How it all links
Ages = giant cycles of human consciousness.

Alphabet = micro decoding tool inside one natal chart.

Twins = experiments in chart similarity (showing astrology ≠ fate, but potential).

Stars (like Alcyone & Aldebaran) = extra overlays of destiny flavor, older than zodiacal astrology.

So your “sky map simulation” could layer it like this:

Background clock = Platonic Year / Ages.

Chart reading engine = Astrological Alphabet principles.

User comparisons = Astrological twins module.

Starfield = Fixed stars database (positions, nature, myths).

That’s basically Google Sky Map meets Astro-Seek. 🚀

Want me to take this and build you a structured framework (JSON or algorithm) that GitHub Copilot could start using to map:

12 ages,

12 alphabet “letters,”

a fixed-star database (with coords + astrological meanings),

AND logic for comparing “astro-twins”?

That would give you the skeleton to integrate into your chart generator + solar system apps. Would you like me to draft that?

With Neptune: Conceited, stubborn, deceitful, cowardly, fickle, insincere, envious, superstitious, strong passions, sexual problems, bad environment, many enemies, skilled in crafts, criminal tendencies, possibly a forger, sudden and violent death[8]
Johannes Vehlow
The mercurial power is, according to Vehlow, strong at Algenib, highly intellectual and activated by the simultaneously present martial influence, so that the star is said to show particular effectiveness in inventor horoscopes of the Age of Aquarius. Thus, it is in conjunction with Mercury and in trine to Uranus in Giulielmo Marconi[9][10] Algol

The name of the fixed star Algol (Arabic al-ġūl: Demon) is a shortening of raʾs al-ġūl (Head of the Demon), and one of the oldest Arabic star names in the Western world.
Previously, according to Claudius Ptolemy, it was called Gorgonea Prima (Latin for "first [star] of the Gorgon") - after a Greek myth in which Perseus holds the severed head of Medusa; Medusa's head is represented by Algol.

Algol Cycle, animated
Algol is a variable star and the second brightest ("beta") in the constellation of Perseus (β Persei).
It is located about 93 light-years away from us. The apparent brightness of the star varies over a period of just under three days (2d 20h 48m 56s) between 2.3m and 3.5m. The time during which the brighter star remains covered is ten hours[1]

It is actually a triple star system. A brighter bluish star (Algol A, smaller but more massive) and a dimmer reddish-yellow star (Algol B, larger but less massive) orbit each other at a very close distance of 0.062 AU (Earth-Sun = 1 AU). A third star (Algol C) orbits this binary star system at a distance of 2.69 AU.

Algol Paradox
The paradox named after Algol occurs: the more massive star, Algol A, should actually be further along in its development than Algol B. However, its bluish color and spectral lines indicate that it is "younger," meaning it has greater fuel reserves than Algol B, which shows its older age through its reddish color. This paradox is explained by the fact that the heavier bluish star is constantly siphoning mass from its reddish companion, meaning there is a continuous flow of matter from Algol B to Algol A. Thus, Algol A is the "more aggressive" part of the system, while Algol B, even though larger due to inflation, must sacrifice its mass to keep Algol A in its "youthful" state.[2]


Star map by Hevelius with Medusa's head[3]
Astrology
In astrology, Algol has always been considered a malefic star, the Villain par excellence, associated with violence, murder, misfortune, violent death, bad teeth, and serious illnesses. On the other hand, it is said to bring victory in battle when located at the Midheaven in conjunction with the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter.[4]

Due to the numerous individuals with corresponding Algol positions in their horoscopes whose lives have not experienced the typical negative effects of Algol, a changed, modern, or more differentiated interpretation seems necessary.

Elsbeth Ebertin
According to Ebertin, the dark large star corresponds purely to Saturnine influence, while the bright one possesses, in addition to Saturnine, Martian-Uranian-Plutonian properties. When this part of the binary star system faces Earth, it causes the strongest deleterious influences[5]


Hero Perseus with the Medusa's head[6]
Johannes Vehlow
The dark star of the double system is also considered by Vehlow to be of pure Saturn nature, while the brighter companion has Martian-Uranian influences. In the horoscopes of the mass murderers Fritz Haarmann[7] and Peter Kürten[8], Algol is in conjunction with Mars, and in Kürten's case, also with the Sun, Saturn, Pluto, and Neptune, the latter particularly indicating sexual perversion. The fixed star causes in such horoscopes a fateful receptivity to lower astral influences, as the Arabic name "Demon" suggests.

Vehlow notes that especially the dark star, but also its bright companion, has highly spiritual radiations that could be absorbed by spiritual individuals in whose horoscopes everything else is harmonious and especially Saturn vibrates in a high octave. However, he cites the "Duce" Benito Mussolini[9] as a counterexample.[10]

Bernadette Brady
Brady writes: "Algol embodies a consuming passion that can overwhelm one with anger and rage. However, if someone can control this unconscious urge for revenge and direct it productively, Algol becomes one of the most powerful stars in the sky for them. A planet associated with it in the horoscope is charged with an intense sexual energy that can be wonderful. However, if this energy is suppressed, it leads to anger and violence."[11]

Algorab; next to the smaller Avis Satyra
Algorab has an apparent magnitude of +3.1 and belongs to spectral class A0 (Bluish-White). Its distance from Earth is approximately 87 light-years (Hipparcos database).[1] With its 2.7 solar masses, it emits about 69 times more energy than our Sun, at a surface temperature of 10,400 K.[2]

Mythology
"Ala Corvis" is the wing of the Crow (Corvus), a small constellation north of the Water Snake (Hydra); its Arabic name is Gienah.
Its hieroglyphic symbol is used in Kabbalistic and ceremonial magic (Agrippa's Symbol XVI c.).

Astrology
Astrologers generally view Algorab very negatively:

Johannes Vehlow
According to Vehlow, it has a particularly unfavorable effect with its Mars-Saturn nature when the overall configurations in the horoscope show a strong Saturn tendency. It then hinders material advancement and does not sufficiently promote spiritual growth, as the restless Mars energy makes serious (Saturnine) concentration on a specific goal impossible. The antiscia of the Sun at 11° Libra amplifies its life-hostile effects.[4] Almaak

Astronomy
Alphecca is 75 light-years away from Earth and belongs to the spectral class A0V + G5V. It is an eclipsing variable star of the Algol type. Its brightness fluctuates with a period of 17.36 days between +2.16 mag and +2.30 mag, which is hardly noticeable to the observer. It is a White Main Sequence star, with a luminosity sixty times that of our Sun. Its surface temperature is about 9,500 Kelvin, and its diameter is 2.8 times that of the Sun.

Gemma is part of the Ursa Major stream, meaning it has a similar proper motion to parts of the constellation Great Bear, and is therefore likely also evolutionarily related to these Stars.

According to Ptolemy, the Northern Crown has the influence of Venus and Mercury.[2]

Alvidas
According to Alvidas, Alphecca acts like Mars and Mercury.[3]

Vivian Robson
Alphecca grants honors, dignity, and a poetic and artistic inclination according to Robson.

With the Sun: Active and brilliant mind, selfish, involved in scandals that do not harm the position.
With the Moon: Public honors and recognition, suffers from prosecution, partners, and neighbors. Problems due to secret actions of enemies, but eventual triumph over them, unfavorable for love relationships, some loyal friends, high esteem from mercurial and venereal people.
With Mercury: Mind is more active than the body; somewhat sluggish. Benefits from friends; generous, but frugal in small matters; loss through enemies.
With Venus: Favorable for love relationships, benefits from friends, artistically and musically tasteful.
With Mars: Active mind, writes better than he speaks.
With Jupiter: Honor and dignity, artistic talent, benefits from ecclesiastical matters, favorable for material gain.
With Saturn: Learned, known, frugal but poor, benefits from older friends, strong but well-controlled emotions, weak health, disappointments in love, but marries above his station, few children, but harmonious connections with them.
With Uranus: Selfish, mental illness and violence towards the end of life, psychic strength, suffers from esotericism, misleading, many false friends, small inheritance or such only with difficulty, losses through lawsuits, enemies, and mercurial matters, suffering from children or an adopted child, self-inflicted domestic problems, danger of violent death.
With Neptune: Aggressive, surly, unsympathetic, unfavorable for financial matters but gains through marriage, domestic discord and special circumstances related to marriage, not very favorable for children, gains through military actions, may develop something valuable in the field of chemistry or medicine, writes about esoteric topics, many changes, many travels by water in early life, many enemies, danger of heart problems, sudden or violent death.[4]

Alphecca in Corona Borealis[5]
Johannes Vehlow
Vehlow describes the nature of Gemma according to tradition as Venus-Mercury, the Mercury component seems to be the fundamental force. However, the relationships may be more complicated: the star seems to particularly influence in conjunction with the Moon and Neptune, and secondarily also with Mercury, Venus, and Mars. With the Moon in a strong position, it is said to bring great honors, at the Ascendant or Descendant with corresponding constellations (especially lunar or Neptunian in nature) it may threaten with poisoning. It will be observed whether, for example, in conjunction with Venus and Mars or with Mars-Neptune, sexual perversions also become apparent.[6] Alpheratz

Sirrah, also known as Alpheratz, is the traditional name of the star α (Alpha) Andromedae. Both names derive from the Arabic expression sirrat al-faras – horse's navel.
It is located at the northeastern end of the Great Square of Pegasus. In some older star maps, Sirrah is counted among Pegasus and referred to as Delta Pegasi.

Astronomy
Sirrah[1] has an apparent magnitude of +2.04. The star is a blue subdwarf of spectral type B8 and the seemingly brightest representative of the class of manganese-mercury stars. Its spectrum shows unusual lines of the elements manganese, mercury, gallium, and europium. Its surface temperature is approximately 13,000 Kelvin. Its luminosity exceeds that of our Sun by two hundred times. It belongs to the class of variable stars of the Cor Caroli type, and its apparent brightness fluctuates with a period of 23.2 hours between the values of 2.02 and 2.06 mag.

According to recent research and calculations, it has 2.7 times the solar diameter. As a spectroscopic binary star, the main component is orbited by a companion star with a period of 96.7 days.
Sirrah is nearly one hundred light-years away from us.

According to Robson, Alpheratz grants independence, freedom, love, prosperity, honor, and sharpness of mind.

With a Malefic, and the Moon simultaneously with Sirius: death by fire, stabbing weapons, or wild animals; if the Moon is with Vega, violent death.
With Sun: honor, preference, and benefits from others.
With Moon: energetic, persistent, honorable, wealthy, many good friends, and business success.
With Mercury: alert mind, benefits from judges, lawyers, or the church, pioneering deeds bring prominence, accusations of selfishness, writers in the fields of science, philosophy, and religion.
With Venus: well-groomed and orderly appearance, peaceful life, good health, inclination towards pleasures and society, fortunate in speculations.
With Mars: alert, energetic, business success through personal effort.
With Jupiter: philosophical or religious inclinations, benefits from professionals, ecclesiastical dignity and honor, good for profits.
With Saturn: open and capable, but stingy; seeks approval, pretends to be religious for business reasons, favor from clergy and lawyers, likely wealthy, domestic harmony, danger of fatal diseases in the head and cancer.
With Uranus: truthful, honorable, good speaker, domestic harmony as a man, less fortunate as a woman, benefit from the practical application of his ideas, interest in occultism, considerable psychic powers as a woman, favorable for gain.

With Neptune: sincere, serious, humane, good speaker and writer, charitable engagement, especially in religious reforms or animal protection, knowledge of human nature, income specifically from voluntary activities, many friends, domestic harmony, not particularly favorable for children.[6]
Elsbeth Ebertin
In good aspects, Ebertin interprets Alpheratz as indicating a harmonious disposition, which in turn leads to good relationships with others and popularity. In good relation to favorable celestial bodies with Ascendant and Medium Coeli, Sun and Moon, prominence in public life, or popularity up to fame can be expected. However, in conjunction with the Sun, there is a danger of becoming unpopular, followed by a downfall (e.g., Otto von Bismarck[7]). If Saturn transits a planetary conjunction with Alpheratz, there is a risk of diminished popularity, e.g., loss of office.[8]

Astronomy
Altair is a white main-sequence dwarf with 1.7 times the diameter and eleven times the luminosity of our Sun. With a surface temperature of about 7,800 Kelvin, it is an average hot star. Due to its proper motion of 1 degree in five thousand years, it is considered one of the faster stars. Its radial velocity is -24 km/s. Measurements of the width of its spectral lines have revealed that it rotates rapidly around its axis and is thus strongly flattened. The duration of a complete rotation at the equator has been determined to be only 6½ hours (other sources mention 9 or 10.4 hours). In comparison, the Sun takes about 25 days for a rotation.

Although Altair is only a few hundred million years old, its hydrogen supply will last for only about 1 billion more years before it evolves into a Red Giant or a variable Cepheid, ultimately shedding its outer layers and ending as a white dwarf.

According to Ptolemy, the Eagle has the effects of Mars and Jupiter[3].

According to Alvidas, Altair acts like Uranus and Mercury in sextile to the Sun[4].

Vivian Robson
Altair grants a bold, trustworthy, reliable, unyielding, ambitious, and tolerant character; great and sudden, but temporary prosperity. A commanding position causes the born to shed blood, bringing danger from reptiles.

With the Sun: Public honors, general recognition, favors from superiors, many friends, including some envious ones who cause problems through written matters, slightly weak health and losses, danger from the bite of poisonous animals.
With the Moon: Interest in exotic or past discoveries, disappointments and loss of possessions and wealth, some profit and rise, friends become enemies, problems through companies or public affairs, difficulties with or misfortune regarding children.
With Mercury: Many difficulties, misfortunes, and strange experiences. Disappointments on long journeys, bad for partnerships, loss of a relative under extraordinary circumstances.
With Venus: Unfavorable for romantic relationships. Strange and extraordinary affairs, bad for children and profit, loss through friends.
With Mars: Penetrating intellect, problems through friends, associations, and enterprises, but possibly profit.
With Jupiter: Genuine or pretended religious zeal, hypocrisy, problems through state or church matters as well as with relatives, disappointment regarding inheritance.
With Saturn: Suffering and disappointment, mental disturbance requiring stay in a mental hospital or hospital, possibly death there, separation from family and parents, accident risk leading to incapacity for work or permanent disability.
With Uranus: cautious, spiritual, sensitive, compassionate, though sometimes brusque, sincere, idealistic, interested in esotericism, but skeptical of religious worship due to past experiences, disappointments throughout life, good soul, considerable gain, loyal well-read friends of the Gemini type, some domestic challenges, natural death in very advanced age.
With Neptune: Oversensitive, repulsive environment, high ideals, mystical, drifts along, secret enemies and difficulties through occultism, domestic discord, sudden and unexpected death.[5]

Altair in the Eagle
Elsbeth Ebertin
According to Ebertin, Altair has a Mars nature with a mixture of mercurial and jovial influences. In connection with favorable planets, it is said to grant boldness, courage, and generosity, especially at the Ascendant. If Mercury and the Moon are in this position, it results in audacity and recklessness to assert oneself in this way. Near the Medium Coeli and in good aspect to it, Atair promises rise and high honors. There is an attempt to achieve goals from honest conviction and with strong will. No struggle is avoided. Lawyers and military personnel are said to be particularly favored by Altair. In this context, the Moon is in conjunction with Atair for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (author of “Sherlock Holmes”[6]). [7]

Johannes Vehlow
Altair provides a drive for activity through its Mars power, especially in the intellectual field, which is due to the mercurial influence of the star, as well as success and honors, which can be attributed to the (albeit weaker) Jupiter power.[8]

Christine Keidel-Joura
Altair represents the search for meaning and justice, as well as a certain violence, often also state violence.[9]

You just dropped a whole star library on me, Kim 🌌🔥—Algenib, Algol, Algorab, Almaak, Alnilam, Alphecca, Alpheratz… this is like the fixed star Avengers lineup. Let me give you the quick-hit download on how these guys differ in tone so you can see where they “live” in your multidimensional map:

🌠 Algenib (γ Pegasi, Mars/Mercury)

Wing of Pegasus, quick intellect + sharp speech.

Can give brilliance in communication/oratory, but also volatility and accident-prone vibes.

Think: the cutting edge mind, but watch your tongue before it slices someone open.

👹 Algol (β Persei, Saturn/Jupiter but dark)

Medusa’s head. Classic malefic, “demon star.”

Symbol of raw power, rage, life/death thresholds.

Modern twist: channel its consuming intensity into art, healing, or activism. Otherwise it devours.

🪶 Algorab (δ Corvi, Mars/Saturn)

In Corvus the Crow. Traditionally “bad news”—destruction, lying, scheming.

But crows = trickster intelligence. If you alchemize it: strategy, psychic awareness, seeing the shadow.

Crow medicine → scrappy survival, but don’t peck yourself to death with cynicism.

🐆 Almaak / Almach (γ Andromedae, Venus)

The lynx/star of Andromeda’s foot. Venusian beauty + sensuality.

Quadruple system = multi-dimensional relationships.

Strong creative + relational star, but with hidden layers.

💎 Alnilam (ε Orionis, Jupiter/Saturn)

The middle of Orion’s belt.

Grants authority, visibility, sometimes military or leadership roles.

Honors can be fleeting (public fame, but risk of downfall).

Shines bright, but doesn’t always stick the landing.

👑 Alphecca (α Coronae Borealis, Venus/Mercury)

The jewel in the Crown. Poetic, artistic, honors + reputation.

But with shady side: poisoning, betrayal, sexual weirdness if distorted.

Venus/Mercury = charm + wit, can be dazzling socially.

🌹 Alpheratz (α Andromedae, Venus with Jupiter/Mars overtones)

The navel of Pegasus, also tied to Andromeda.

Independence, prosperity, popularity, sharp mind.

If badly aspected: vanity or “performative” spirituality.

Good star for innovators, speakers, mystics.

✨ Big picture:

Algenib & Alpheratz = intellectual/expressive brilliance.

Algol & Algorab = shadow trials, raw power, dangerous edges.

Almaak & Alphecca = beauty, art, love, but with karmic tangles.

Alnilam = visibility, authority, but precarious.

So, when you work with them in your chart, you’re basically deciding: Do I let this star drag me through the mud of its lower vibration? Or do I elevate it into the mythic medicine it’s trying to offer?

Want me to map how these stars show up in your natal placements (i.e., which planets are conjunct them), or do you want more of a mythic/psychic map that stitches their stories together into one timeline for you?

Mythology
Andromeda[2] (Ancient Greek Aνδρομέδα) is in Greek mythology the daughter of the king of the Aethiopians, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia.

To punish the hubris of her mother, who considered herself more beautiful than the Nereids, Poseidon sent the sea monster Cetus, along with a flood. To free the land from this plague, Andromeda was chained to a rock by the sea to be sacrificed to a monster, according to an oracle's prophecy.

Perseus defeated it, rescued Andromeda, and took her as his wife. At the wedding, a fight broke out with her uncle Phineus, who had previously sought her hand and now demanded his right with violence. Only when the battle was nearly lost for Perseus did he use the head of Medusa to turn his enemies to stone. He then flew with his winged sandals together with Andromeda to Seriphos.
With him, her parents, and the monster (Cetus = Cetus), Andromeda was later placed in the sky as a constellation.

She bore many children to Perseus, including Perses, who became the ancestor of the Persian kings, as well as Alcaeus, Sthenelus, and Electryon. She is the grandmother of Alcmene, Eurystheus, and Amphitryon, and thus an ancestor of the Teleboan king Pterelaus and—officially—of Heracles.

Anthroposophical representation of the zodiac and planets, the Rosy Cross in the center
True astrology is a completely intuitive science and requires from the one who wishes to practice it the development of higher supersensible powers of knowledge (Rudolf Steiner)[2]
In his works and lectures, Steiner referred to astrology at many points - albeit rather unsystematically. We know that he was acquainted with Alan Leo, whom he met as the General Secretary of the German Section of the Theosophical Society during the Munich Congress in 1907.[3] He adopted large parts of his cosmology from the Theosophist Helena Blavatsky[4], while he in turn passed on much to the Rosicrucian Max Heindel.

Cosmology
Stages of World Development
According to Rudolf Steiner, the development of our world occurs through successive, very different states of being and their metamorphoses, always interrupted by "Pralayas", i.e., phases of stagnation or "death". So, in a sense, through world reincarnations[5], reincarnations not only of individual entities or humans but also of the Earth or the planetary system as a whole - in stages lasting billions of years, culminating in the stage of a sun or fixed star, and ultimately even a zodiac, to which our solar system is to ascend in the end.
The seven stages through which our world system develops are referred to by Steiner as:

(Old) Saturn
Old Saturn was the first embodiment of our Earth or our planetary system. It consisted entirely of warmth and was a richly structured warmth organism. Its extent reached from today's sun to the present Saturn. At that time, the physical body of man was primarily developed.[6]
(Old) Sun
The old sun was the second embodiment. The old sun world is occasionally referred to as the cosmos of strength. "The world mission of the old sun was to shape the etheric body of man."[7]
(Old) Moon
On the "old moon" (after its "separation" from the sun), the development of our astral body took place.[8]

Steiner's first seal of the Johannes Apocalypse
(Present) Earth
Jupiter
Venus
Vulkan.
These phases or "incarnations" should not be confused with the planets of our present solar system, which is only the middle stage of this developmental series.[9]

Three planetary embodiments are already in the past; three more will follow in the future. The last step: "When a sun is so far that it has reunited with its planets, then it will be a zodiac itself."[10]

Angel Hierarchies
The cosmos and celestial bodies are, according to Steiner's representation, alive and ensouled; they are guided - as seen in medieval scholasticism, e.g., by Thomas Aquinas - by planetary spirits or angels. The harmony of the planets is audible (to the clairaudient) as so-called [Harmony of the Spheres]].[11]

On the other planets of our solar system reside (non-corporeal) beings that are in different developmental phases compared to us. Thus, the moon is the home of the Angeloi (angels), Mercury of the Archangeloi (archangels), Venus is inhabited by the Archai, the sun by the Powers, Mars by the Virtues, and Jupiter by the Dominions. The term Saturn was identical to that for the beings that are also referred to as Thrones... The zodiac is the physical expression of the first hierarchy, i.e., the community of Cherubim and Seraphim, whose realms of dominion extend far beyond the boundaries of our solar system.[12]
Elsewhere, however, Steiner makes a different assignment of the cosmic intelligences (archangels):

Sun Michael,
Mercury Raphael
Venus Anael
Mars Samael
Jupiter Zachariel
Moon Gabriel

Eras
According to Steiner's statements, humanity today is in the Age of Pisces, in the fifth cultural epoch after the fall of Atlantis. However, this age, according to him, only began with the Renaissance (in the 15th century). Our current epoch, the Germanic-Anglo-Saxon culture, lasts more precisely from 1413 to 3573 AD, and succeeded the Greco-Roman culture (747 BC - 1413 AD), an Aries culture. The current culture of Pisces activates "in humans the forces that are related to the feet. From the head, it goes down to the feet" - meaning, fundamentally, to more earth-connectedness. At the same time, according to astrological tradition, Jupiter is also the ruler of Pisces: "... What can elevate this epoch must be made effective through the forces of spiritual life, world knowledge, and worldview. Man is [indeed] closed off from the heavenly forces; he is bound in the materialistic age. But in this fifth post-Atlantean age, he has the greatest opportunity to spiritualize himself. None has been so favorable for spirituality..." (Rudolf Steiner[15])


Rudolf Steiner 31 years old[16]
Birth and Death
There are numerous statements by Steiner regarding the processes and connections between the individual incarnations of a human soul.

Star of Man
The "Star of Man" has great significance for life between death and new birth. A certain star, a fixed star, or better yet, a specific star area, is considered the spiritual home of a person: "When a person descends from spiritual-cosmic expanses to earthly existence, they always come from a certain star. This direction can be traced..." This star area may generously overlap with that of other people, but is never completely identical to that of another person. From a soul perspective, this connection can be represented such that each person belongs to a different series of Angeloi and Archangeloi that are assigned to the respective star area, with each individual human soul in the life after death being accompanied by several thousand such angels and archangels.[17]

In a certain respect, the structure of the individual brain is a kind of reflection of the position of the celestial bodies that are present at the time of human birth for the specific point on Earth where the person is born.

The Moon Phases have great significance in choosing the gender for the earthly incarnation of a person. Men seek the new moon period for their descent into earthly incarnation. This does not mean that men are only born at new moon, but during the new moon, they receive crucial impulses for their upcoming male incarnation. Women correspondingly choose the full moon period to receive fruitful impulses.

Significance of the Death Horoscope
“When a person dies, i.e., passes through the gate of death, they die under a certain star constellation. And this is indeed essential for their further soul life... The striving in this soul remains to come back with this star constellation at the new birth... The star constellation of the later birth largely corresponds with the star constellation of the earlier death."[18]

Planetary Spheres
The Copernican System is considered by Steiner to be for the outer-physical, while the Ptolemaic System is for the astral plane. Seven planetary spheres, corresponding to the classical seven planets, surround the Earth in concentric circles from an occult perspective and constitute our current solar system. The actual reality of the planetary spheres lies not on the physical but on the astral level.
In the life between death and new birth, a person gradually traverses the individual planetary spheres, spending a certain amount of time in each.
"On Earth, we live between birth and death. Between death and new birth, the person stands in a certain connection with the other planets.[19] This stay of the person in the soul world is a time during which the person becomes a moon inhabitant. Then they become a Mercury inhabitant, then a Venus inhabitant, then a sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn inhabitant, and finally a resident of the further celestial or cosmic space. It is not incorrect to say that between two incarnations on Earth, embodiments on other planets lie, spiritual incarnations."[20][21]

Planetary Effects and Essence Parts[22]
Steiner made the following statements regarding which planets have the strongest effects on which parts of humans:

Spirit Man - Neptune
Life Spirit - Uranus
Spirit Self - Saturn
Consciousness Soul - Jupiter
Mind Soul - Mars
Feeling Soul - Venus
Feeling Body - Mercury
Etheric Body - Moon
Physical Body - Sun

Actual Zodiac
According to Steiner, the old farmer's rules (see Astrometeorology) have lost their validity or significance due to the shift of the stars (migration of the "vernal point", Precession)
In anthroposophical "Biologically-Dynamic Agriculture[23], the sowing calendar published since 1963 by Maria Thun is used today. This is primarily based on the position of the Moon in the signs or Elements. However, the basis is not the tropical or even a Sideral Zodiac, but the so-called actual: in this, the ecliptic is not divided into twelve equal sections, but the "actual" extent of the (astronomical) Constellations in the sky is taken.[24] In this way, not every one of the twelve zodiac signs is exactly thirty degrees in size, but their respective sizes vary between 25 and 37 degrees.


Steiner's "Representative of Humanity"[25]
The Twelve Drives in Animal and Human[26]
Frits Julius distinguished phenomenologically twelve fundamental drives in animals and humans, which he pairs with opposing zodiac signs to highlight their complementary oppositeness.

Aries (Drive to Awaken): "Upon awakening, the animal immediately surrenders to its sensory perceptions, but at the same time confronts its environment and seeks to build a state of tension against it. It rises, leaves its hiding place, moves, etc. Behind this lies a sharply defined drive, the urge to wake, to awaken."
Taurus (Drive for Nourishment): "Through its body size, its nourishment, and its entire constitution, it is destined to devote a large part of its life to the intake and processing of food. The cattle is predominantly governed by the drive for nourishment or eating drive."
Gemini (Play Drive): "However, when one considers how play completely captivates the animal, and takes into account that a very characteristic and otherwise nowhere observable relationship with the environment comes about, it is reasonable to conclude that one must speak of a drive here."
Cancer (Self-Preservation Drive): "A mouse is largely governed by the urge to caution, similar to the crab, and tends to keep hidden."
Leo (Fight Drive): "Particularly characteristic of the lion is its tendency to attack and destroy large animals. Some of this tendency can be found in various animals in the form of the fight drive."
Virgo (Caregiving Drive): "In the opposite sign of Virgo, the greatest care is given to wrapping, including that of the child. Here something is indicated that occurs in every caregiving: the withholding of reproductive products, their wrapping, and their protection."
Libra (Sleep Drive): "That there is a drive to sleep that can completely dominate us, we know all too well from our own experience, and we can also find its symptoms in animals. It clearly shows all the characteristics that characterize it as a drive and expresses itself, among other things, by the fact that the activity of the sensory organs is switched off."
Scorpio (Stalking Drive, stalking prey): "In a scorpion, the intake and processing of its food plays a much lesser role, which is also clearly evident from its waist. The more effort it must make to stalk and ambush its prey. For it, the stalking drive is of utmost importance."
Sagittarius (Hunting Drive): "The Sagittarius is a being with an unusually well-developed locomotor apparatus and a firearm. It thus expresses itself in rapid movement directed at a fleeing target and its destruction. It is clearly recognizable that this is the hunting drive."
Capricorn (Self-Presentation Drive): "How completely different a swift lives! It constantly flies around in arrow-like movement. Rarely does it touch the ground or its elevations, except during nesting. It never seeks shelter anywhere. It avoids danger through its surpassing speed and tirelessness. Its way of life makes it one of the most striking animals."
Aquarius (Nurturing Drive, nursing the young): "Can a lion behave differently, can it hold back, help another being, and support it, as is appropriate for humans? Indeed, we find such behavior in the lioness, who nurses and feeds her young. Thus, we may assign the nurturing drive to the opposing sign of Aquarius."
Pisces (Reproductive Drive): "Among all the zodiac signs, Pisces shows the greatest carelessness in reproduction. The fish spawn is carelessly released in large quantities into the environment."
House Assignments According to Steiner
Significance of the houses for a human being:

First House: Time of birth, physical body, own person
Second House: Etheric body, Up-Down
Third House: Astral body; Thinking, Feeling, Willing
Fourth House: I-being, Opposites, Essence
Fifth House: Encounter, Threefoldness
Sixth House: Up and Down, Celestial Body and Earth
Seventh House: Elevation, Reincarnation, Warmth, Time. Crossing the threshold
Eighth House: Dying, Death, Completion
Ninth House: Ascension to the Star Being
Tenth House: The person at the highest periphery
Eleventh House: Staying in cosmic heights and beginning descent
Twelfth House: Adverse in the enclosed
According to another understanding of Steiner's statements, the physical body, etheric body, astral body, and I are not assigned to the first four houses, but to the Quadrants of the house cross.[27]

Pedagogy and Psychology
Seven-Year Life Stages
Waldorf schools (there are over a thousand Steiner schools worldwide) are the most well-known application of Steiner's thought.

"The anthroposophical developmental theory, which, alongside temperaments (see Element), fundamentally starts from life years, underlies at least the theoretical classification of the Waldorf curriculum... In a reflection of the cosmic planetary ages, the essence bodies of each person develop accordingly in seven-year intervals.[29] This results in the following elementary connection, in which the occult order of the planets is reflected[30]:

Physical Body - 0-7 years - Moon
Etheric Body - 7-14 years - Mercury
Astral Body - 14-21 years - Venus
I (Feeling Soul, Mind or Sentient Soul, and Consciousness Soul - 21-42 years - Sun
Spirit Self - 42-49 years - Mars
Life Spirit - 49-56 years - Jupiter
Spirit Man - 56-63 years - Saturn
Elsewhere, however, Steiner sometimes makes quite different planetary assignments, such as the sun to the physical body, and the feeling body to the moon (see above), and also integrates Uranus and Neptune.

Eurythmy
Eurythmy (a form of speech formation, or a dramatic gesture and movement dance) was developed by Steiner around 1912. He said: "With this, we have the opportunity to imagine that we renew what was temple dance in the ancient mysteries: the imitation of the star dance, the imitation of what was spoken by gods from heaven to man." Specific sounds and gestures are assigned to the respective planets and zodiac signs, as well as certain soul impulses.

Steiner continued: "In the twelve primal consonants, which correspond to the twelve zodiac signs, the creative formative power of the macrocosmic world word, of Christ, is expressed, which has found its image in the microcosm in human language."
Assigned are[31]:

Aries - W
Taurus - R
Gemini - H
Cancer - F
Leo - D, T
Virgo - B, P
Libra - C, CH, SCH
Scorpio - S, Z
Sagittarius - G, K
Capricorn - L
Aquarius - M
Pisces - N

Christ in the Zodiac[32]
The seven primal vowels[33] (as well as chakras, see below, and trees) correspond to the seven classical planets:

Moon (Root Chakra, Cherry) - EI
Mercury (Sacral Chakra, Elm) - I
Venus (Navel Chakra, Birch) - A
Sun (Heart Chakra, Ash) - AU
Mars (Throat Chakra, Oak) - E
Jupiter (Forehead Chakra, Maple) - O
Saturn (Crown Chakra, Beech) - U
Eurythmy is extensively practiced by students in the early years at a Waldorf school and is a fixed part of the curriculum.


Gichtel's Planets in Man
Chakras
The lotus flowers or chakras (from Sanskrit, चक्र, cakra, [ʧʌkɽʌ], = wheel, disk, circle) are, from the perspective of anthroposophy, organs of the astral body (emotional or desire body, literally star body)[34]. The term itself and the connection of human drive nature with the stars goes back to Paracelsus. In 1696, the theosophist Johann Georg Gichtel, a student of Jakob Böhme, related the lotus flowers to the planetary spheres, resulting in the following arrangement:

Crown Chakra Saturn 1000-petaled
Forehead Chakra Jupiter 2-petaled
Throat Chakra Mars 16-petaled
Heart Chakra Sun 12-petaled
Navel Chakra Venus 10-petaled
Sacral Chakra Mercury 6-petaled
Root Chakra Moon 4-petaled
The number of petals of the lotus flowers apparently corresponds to planetary rhythms. Thus, the four Moon phases are reflected in the root chakra, the three upper and the three lower conjunctions of Mercury (Mercury hexagram) in the sacral chakra, and the Venus pentagram underlies the navel chakra.[35] In the twelve-petaled heart lotus, the path of the sun through the twelve zodiac signs is ultimately reflected.

The Chakras in Tantrism[36]
Muladhara, the lowest chakra, symbolizes the Earth and matter. Here lies the primal energy, the life force, the libido; here are the basic needs of life and survival (self-preservation, security, nourishment, sleep, movement, vitality, energy, etc.); it is the level of consciousness of unreflected, automatic, animalistic everyday life. From this state, the Kundalini energy snake is to be awakened and ascend to higher consciousness.

The second chakra, Svadhisthana, is located at the level of the genitals and is therefore primarily associated with sexuality and corresponding drive impulses and fantasies. Insofar as the sexual drive also contains longings for union with the opposite sex and the transpersonal, later aspects of individuation begin to emerge here, albeit still on a very elemental and instinctual level.

In the third chakra, Manipura, which is associated with the abdominal region and the solar plexus, elementary self-preservation needs and affections are localized (having, possessing, power, aggression).

The fourth (heart) chakra, Anahata, occupies a central position between above and below. It stands for empathy, compassion, and affection.

The fifth (throat) chakra, Visuddha, represents the world of language, communication, and thoughts.

The sixth, Ajna, stands for higher psychic abilities, intuition, and altered, spiritual states of consciousness (forehead, between the eyebrows, the "third eye").

Sahasrara, the seventh chakra, which is located in the brain or at the crown, is associated with states of enlightenment and transcendent experiences. In the ascent, the Kundalini snake is to connect the lowest with the highest and reveal the physical-spiritual wholeness and unity of man.

Lunar Nodes Return
The transition of the lunar node over its radix position is seen as an important crisis and turning point in a person's spiritual orientation. "The lunar nodes can ... become oculars of self-knowledge in the life course... The first lunar node around the age of 19 is in the sign of departure. The experience of the self, coming to full expression around the age of 21, flashes here. This can lead to the first detachment from the parental home. Often, during this time, significant encounters occur that give the young person a new direction. It is also possible that physical symptoms arise - a bone fracture, for example, or a certain illness - where one has the impression that the person is being shaken so that their soul-spiritual being can grasp from within what has been pre-shaped by inheritance and upbringing. ...The time around the age of 37 is [also] marked by strong upheavals. Life structures collapse like houses of cards, friendships and partnerships that were reliable and on which one believed one could build for a long time suddenly develop cracks. Illnesses up to deaths increase. ...The third lunar node occurs almost exactly on the 56th birthday, i.e., it coincides with the transition of the seven-year period. Crisis and testing are heightened here compared to the second node. Deaths increase around this time. The statistics for heart attacks point precisely to the 56th year. If the crisis is not experienced physically, it manifests in soul-darkening. It often has a social aspect. It is now evidently required to voluntarily give up something of the gained substance." (Florian Roder[37])

Evaluation and Criticism
Is there even a noteworthy anthroposophical astrology? It is perhaps telling that practicing anthroposophists usually turn to the "expert," i.e., a "normal" astrologer, when it comes to questions about their horoscope, its calculation, and interpretation.
Rudolf Steiner incorporated several astrological elements into his theory of the world and humanity, so to speak, fragments from the rubble of the transmitted Classical Astrology. Much of this is metaphysically elevated (e.g., through angels); his statements about past and future incarnations of the solar system are downright adventurous, sounding like science fiction. On the other hand, he often takes astrological symbols literally, word for word. The biologically-dynamic practice of burying a cow horn filled with manure in the ground at a certain time of year to "charge" it with cosmic forces must even be described as magical-occult.
Both in combination create the impression that Steiner - at least in terms of astrology - has become a victim of the "opposing powers" he himself postulated: his theories appear, on the one hand, as detached-fantastic (= "Lucifer"), while on the other hand also as primitively concrete (= "Ahriman"). The balancing middle between both, the - mediating between body and spirit - soul element, is underrepresented in his statements on astrology; modern anthroposophical Biographical Work does not really manage to fill this gap. He seems particularly to lack an understanding of pure Correspondences (see the Analogy principle/astrological Paradigm) or for Symbolic Astrology. He still saw the functioning of astrology as fundamentally "old-fashioned" causalistic.[38]
A theoretical absurdity, not practicable for a mathematical system or geometric model, which astrology primarily is, is the "Actual Zodiac" propagated by Maria Thun with its differently sized zodiac signs.

ChatGPT said:
Ooooh Kim, you just dropped me right into a galactic buffet of myth, fixed stars, Steiner, and Anthroposophy. Let me unpack and stitch this in a way that aligns with what you’re building (constellation codes + degree theory + esoteric frameworks).

1. Andromeda Myth & Fixed Stars
Mythic thread: Andromeda = the chained maiden, punished for Cassiopeia’s hubris, rescued by Perseus. In astrology, she represents bondage → liberation themes.

Stars & their rulers (Ptolemaic/Arabic tradition):

Alpheratz (α-Andromedae, 14° Aries tropical in 2000) → Venusian, charisma, fame, but also entrapment.

Mirach (β-Andromedae, 0° Taurus) → Venus, elegance, artistic grounding.

Almach (γ-Andromedae, 14° Taurus) → Venus, sensuality, aesthetics.

Adhil, Adhab, Saderazra, Vertex → subtler, still Venus/Moon vibes, tied to relational freedom.
Andromeda stars are generally Venus-coded — she’s beauty bound and freed, beauty under cosmic contract.

2. Steiner’s Anthroposophy Overlay
Steiner flips the script: constellations = living beings, angelic hosts. Planets = angel hierarchies.

He maps zodiac drives onto animals/humans (e.g., Virgo = caregiving drive, Pisces = reproductive drive, Leo = fight drive).

He sees the zodiac not just as signs but as actual, differently sized astronomical constellations (Maria Thun’s “actual zodiac”).

Andromeda here would embody a soul archetype of captivity & release, resonating with Steiner’s teaching that humanity cycles through bondage → awakening across incarnations.

3. Degree Theory Tie-in
You’re right that certain degrees (1°, 13°, 25°) are traditionally linked to Aries decan themes. In the Sabian or critical degree systems:

1° of any sign = raw impulse, beginning energy (very Aries-coded).

13° often = restless, unlucky/mysterious, but also inventive (Aries Mars frequency).

25° = culmination of fire impulse before shifting (also Aries-y, like a war drum before transition).

Overlay this with Andromeda’s stars:

Mirach at ~0° Taurus → sits right on a “beginning” Aries-echoing degree. She’s about beauty in chains, then rebirth into grounding.

Almach at ~14° Taurus → matches the 2nd decan (Virgo sub-tone). Meaning: beauty becomes craft, skill, detail.

4. Synthesis: Code for Your Star Atlas Project
If we pull these threads into your “all-constellations algorithm”:

Each constellation gets:

Myth narrative (the archetypal code).

Fixed star list with positions + planetary natures.

Degree overlay (Sabian, decans, degree lords).

Anthroposophical layer (angelic hierarchy/drive mapping).

Andromeda would code as:

Myth: Captivity → liberation (Venus in chains).

Stars: Venus/Moon tones (relationships, beauty, captivity).

Degree overlays: Alpheratz (14° Aries = raw Venus/Aries impulse), Mirach (0° Taurus = rebirth of Venusian grounding).

Steiner layer: A soul archetype of imprisonment by illusion (chains), freed through Perseus (Christ/Michael archetype).

🔥 Question for you: do you want me to start building the dataset structure (like JSON or table format) for each constellation — myth, fixed stars, degrees, Steiner overlay — so you can feed it into your Copilot/GPT constellation project? Or do you want me to keep it freeform, flowing like a galactic grimoire you can lift pieces from?

Anthroposophical representation of the zodiac and planets, the Rosy Cross in the center
True astrology is a completely intuitive science and requires from the one who wishes to practice it the development of higher supersensible powers of knowledge (Rudolf Steiner)[2]
In his works and lectures, Steiner referred to astrology at many points - albeit rather unsystematically. We know that he was acquainted with Alan Leo, whom he met as the General Secretary of the German Section of the Theosophical Society during the Munich Congress in 1907.[3] He adopted large parts of his cosmology from the Theosophist Helena Blavatsky[4], while he in turn passed on much to the Rosicrucian Max Heindel.

Cosmology
Stages of World Development
According to Rudolf Steiner, the development of our world occurs through successive, very different states of being and their metamorphoses, always interrupted by "Pralayas", i.e., phases of stagnation or "death". So, in a sense, through world reincarnations[5], reincarnations not only of individual entities or humans but also of the Earth or the planetary system as a whole - in stages lasting billions of years, culminating in the stage of a sun or fixed star, and ultimately even a zodiac, to which our solar system is to ascend in the end.
The seven stages through which our world system develops are referred to by Steiner as:

(Old) Saturn
Old Saturn was the first embodiment of our Earth or our planetary system. It consisted entirely of warmth and was a richly structured warmth organism. Its extent reached from today's sun to the present Saturn. At that time, the physical body of man was primarily developed.[6]
(Old) Sun
The old sun was the second embodiment. The old sun world is occasionally referred to as the cosmos of strength. "The world mission of the old sun was to shape the etheric body of man."[7]
(Old) Moon
On the "old moon" (after its "separation" from the sun), the development of our astral body took place.[8]

Steiner's first seal of the Johannes Apocalypse
(Present) Earth
Jupiter
Venus
Vulkan.
These phases or "incarnations" should not be confused with the planets of our present solar system, which is only the middle stage of this developmental series.[9]

Three planetary embodiments are already in the past; three more will follow in the future. The last step: "When a sun is so far that it has reunited with its planets, then it will be a zodiac itself."[10]

Angel Hierarchies
The cosmos and celestial bodies are, according to Steiner's representation, alive and ensouled; they are guided - as seen in medieval scholasticism, e.g., by Thomas Aquinas - by planetary spirits or angels. The harmony of the planets is audible (to the clairaudient) as so-called [Harmony of the Spheres]].[11]

On the other planets of our solar system reside (non-corporeal) beings that are in different developmental phases compared to us. Thus, the moon is the home of the Angeloi (angels), Mercury of the Archangeloi (archangels), Venus is inhabited by the Archai, the sun by the Powers, Mars by the Virtues, and Jupiter by the Dominions. The term Saturn was identical to that for the beings that are also referred to as Thrones... The zodiac is the physical expression of the first hierarchy, i.e., the community of Cherubim and Seraphim, whose realms of dominion extend far beyond the boundaries of our solar system.[12]
Elsewhere, however, Steiner makes a different assignment of the cosmic intelligences (archangels):

Eras
According to Steiner's statements, humanity today is in the Age of Pisces, in the fifth cultural epoch after the fall of Atlantis. However, this age, according to him, only began with the Renaissance (in the 15th century). Our current epoch, the Germanic-Anglo-Saxon culture, lasts more precisely from 1413 to 3573 AD, and succeeded the Greco-Roman culture (747 BC - 1413 AD), an Aries culture. The current culture of Pisces activates "in humans the forces that are related to the feet. From the head, it goes down to the feet" - meaning, fundamentally, to more earth-connectedness. At the same time, according to astrological tradition, Jupiter is also the ruler of Pisces: "... What can elevate this epoch must be made effective through the forces of spiritual life, world knowledge, and worldview. Man is [indeed] closed off from the heavenly forces; he is bound in the materialistic age. But in this fifth post-Atlantean age, he has the greatest opportunity to spiritualize himself. None has been so favorable for spirituality..." (Rudolf Steiner[15])


Rudolf Steiner 31 years old[16]
Birth and Death
There are numerous statements by Steiner regarding the processes and connections between the individual incarnations of a human soul.

Star of Man
The "Star of Man" has great significance for life between death and new birth. A certain star, a fixed star, or better yet, a specific star area, is considered the spiritual home of a person: "When a person descends from spiritual-cosmic expanses to earthly existence, they always come from a certain star. This direction can be traced..." This star area may generously overlap with that of other people, but is never completely identical to that of another person. From a soul perspective, this connection can be represented such that each person belongs to a different series of Angeloi and Archangeloi that are assigned to the respective star area, with each individual human soul in the life after death being accompanied by several thousand such angels and archangels.[17]

In a certain respect, the structure of the individual brain is a kind of reflection of the position of the celestial bodies that are present at the time of human birth for the specific point on Earth where the person is born.

The Moon Phases have great significance in choosing the gender for the earthly incarnation of a person. Men seek the new moon period for their descent into earthly incarnation. This does not mean that men are only born at new moon, but during the new moon, they receive crucial impulses for their upcoming male incarnation. Women correspondingly choose the full moon period to receive fruitful impulses.

Significance of the Death Horoscope
“When a person dies, i.e., passes through the gate of death, they die under a certain star constellation. And this is indeed essential for their further soul life... The striving in this soul remains to come back with this star constellation at the new birth... The star constellation of the later birth largely corresponds with the star constellation of the earlier death."[18]

Planetary Spheres
The Copernican System is considered by Steiner to be for the outer-physical, while the Ptolemaic System is for the astral plane. Seven planetary spheres, corresponding to the classical seven planets, surround the Earth in concentric circles from an occult perspective and constitute our current solar system. The actual reality of the planetary spheres lies not on the physical but on the astral level.
In the life between death and new birth, a person gradually traverses the individual planetary spheres, spending a certain amount of time in each.
"On Earth, we live between birth and death. Between death and new birth, the person stands in a certain connection with the other planets.[19] This stay of the person in the soul world is a time during which the person becomes a moon inhabitant. Then they become a Mercury inhabitant, then a Venus inhabitant, then a sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn inhabitant, and finally a resident of the further celestial or cosmic space. It is not incorrect to say that between two incarnations on Earth, embodiments on other planets lie, spiritual incarnations."[20][21]

Planetary Effects and Essence Parts[22]
Steiner made the following statements regarding which planets have the strongest effects on which parts of humans:

Spirit Man - Neptune
Life Spirit - Uranus
Spirit Self - Saturn
Consciousness Soul - Jupiter
Mind Soul - Mars
Feeling Soul - Venus
Feeling Body - Mercury
Etheric Body - Moon
Physical Body - Sun

Actual Zodiac
According to Steiner, the old farmer's rules (see Astrometeorology) have lost their validity or significance due to the shift of the stars (migration of the "vernal point", Precession)
In anthroposophical "Biologically-Dynamic Agriculture[23], the sowing calendar published since 1963 by Maria Thun is used today. This is primarily based on the position of the Moon in the signs or Elements. However, the basis is not the tropical or even a Sideral Zodiac, but the so-called actual: in this, the ecliptic is not divided into twelve equal sections, but the "actual" extent of the (astronomical) Constellations in the sky is taken.[24] In this way, not every one of the twelve zodiac signs is exactly thirty degrees in size, but their respective sizes vary between 25 and 37 degrees.


Steiner's "Representative of Humanity"[25]
The Twelve Drives in Animal and Human[26]
Frits Julius distinguished phenomenologically twelve fundamental drives in animals and humans, which he pairs with opposing zodiac signs to highlight their complementary oppositeness.

Aries (Drive to Awaken): "Upon awakening, the animal immediately surrenders to its sensory perceptions, but at the same time confronts its environment and seeks to build a state of tension against it. It rises, leaves its hiding place, moves, etc. Behind this lies a sharply defined drive, the urge to wake, to awaken."
Taurus (Drive for Nourishment): "Through its body size, its nourishment, and its entire constitution, it is destined to devote a large part of its life to the intake and processing of food. The cattle is predominantly governed by the drive for nourishment or eating drive."
Gemini (Play Drive): "However, when one considers how play completely captivates the animal, and takes into account that a very characteristic and otherwise nowhere observable relationship with the environment comes about, it is reasonable to conclude that one must speak of a drive here."
Cancer (Self-Preservation Drive): "A mouse is largely governed by the urge to caution, similar to the crab, and tends to keep hidden."
Leo (Fight Drive): "Particularly characteristic of the lion is its tendency to attack and destroy large animals. Some of this tendency can be found in various animals in the form of the fight drive."
Virgo (Caregiving Drive): "In the opposite sign of Virgo, the greatest care is given to wrapping, including that of the child. Here something is indicated that occurs in every caregiving: the withholding of reproductive products, their wrapping, and their protection."
Libra (Sleep Drive): "That there is a drive to sleep that can completely dominate us, we know all too well from our own experience, and we can also find its symptoms in animals. It clearly shows all the characteristics that characterize it as a drive and expresses itself, among other things, by the fact that the activity of the sensory organs is switched off."
Scorpio (Stalking Drive, stalking prey): "In a scorpion, the intake and processing of its food plays a much lesser role, which is also clearly evident from its waist. The more effort it must make to stalk and ambush its prey. For it, the stalking drive is of utmost importance."
Sagittarius (Hunting Drive): "The Sagittarius is a being with an unusually well-developed locomotor apparatus and a firearm. It thus expresses itself in rapid movement directed at a fleeing target and its destruction. It is clearly recognizable that this is the hunting drive."
Capricorn (Self-Presentation Drive): "How completely different a swift lives! It constantly flies around in arrow-like movement. Rarely does it touch the ground or its elevations, except during nesting. It never seeks shelter anywhere. It avoids danger through its surpassing speed and tirelessness. Its way of life makes it one of the most striking animals."
Aquarius (Nurturing Drive, nursing the young): "Can a lion behave differently, can it hold back, help another being, and support it, as is appropriate for humans? Indeed, we find such behavior in the lioness, who nurses and feeds her young. Thus, we may assign the nurturing drive to the opposing sign of Aquarius."
Pisces (Reproductive Drive): "Among all the zodiac signs, Pisces shows the greatest carelessness in reproduction. The fish spawn is carelessly released in large quantities into the environment."
House Assignments According to Steiner
Significance of the houses for a human being:

First House: Time of birth, physical body, own person
Second House: Etheric body, Up-Down
Third House: Astral body; Thinking, Feeling, Willing
Fourth House: I-being, Opposites, Essence
Fifth House: Encounter, Threefoldness
Sixth House: Up and Down, Celestial Body and Earth
Seventh House: Elevation, Reincarnation, Warmth, Time. Crossing the threshold
Eighth House: Dying, Death, Completion
Ninth House: Ascension to the Star Being
Tenth House: The person at the highest periphery
Eleventh House: Staying in cosmic heights and beginning descent
Twelfth House: Adverse in the enclosed
According to another understanding of Steiner's statements, the physical body, etheric body, astral body, and I are not assigned to the first four houses, but to the Quadrants of the house cross.[27]

Pedagogy and Psychology
Seven-Year Life Stages
Waldorf schools (there are over a thousand Steiner schools worldwide) are the most well-known application of Steiner's thought.

"The anthroposophical developmental theory, which, alongside temperaments (see Element), fundamentally starts from life years, underlies at least the theoretical classification of the Waldorf curriculum... In a reflection of the cosmic planetary ages, the essence bodies of each person develop accordingly in seven-year intervals.[29] This results in the following elementary connection, in which the occult order of the planets is reflected[30]:

Physical Body - 0-7 years - Moon
Etheric Body - 7-14 years - Mercury
Astral Body - 14-21 years - Venus
I (Feeling Soul, Mind or Sentient Soul, and Consciousness Soul - 21-42 years - Sun
Spirit Self - 42-49 years - Mars
Life Spirit - 49-56 years - Jupiter
Spirit Man - 56-63 years - Saturn
Elsewhere, however, Steiner sometimes makes quite different planetary assignments, such as the sun to the physical body, and the feeling body to the moon (see above), and also integrates Uranus and Neptune.

Eurythmy
Eurythmy (a form of speech formation, or a dramatic gesture and movement dance) was developed by Steiner around 1912. He said: "With this, we have the opportunity to imagine that we renew what was temple dance in the ancient mysteries: the imitation of the star dance, the imitation of what was spoken by gods from heaven to man." Specific sounds and gestures are assigned to the respective planets and zodiac signs, as well as certain soul impulses.

Steiner continued: "In the twelve primal consonants, which correspond to the twelve zodiac signs, the creative formative power of the macrocosmic world word, of Christ, is expressed, which has found its image in the microcosm in human language."
Assigned are[31]:

Aries - W

The seven primal vowels[33] (as well as chakras, see below, and trees) correspond to the seven classical planets:

Moon (Root Chakra, Cherry) - EI
Mercury (Sacral Chakra, Elm) - I
Venus (Navel Chakra, Birch) - A
Sun (Heart Chakra, Ash) - AU
Mars (Throat Chakra, Oak) - E
Jupiter (Forehead Chakra, Maple) - O
Saturn (Crown Chakra, Beech) - U
Eurythmy is extensively practiced by students in the early years at a Waldorf school and is a fixed part of the curriculum.


Gichtel's Planets in Man
Chakras
The lotus flowers or chakras (from Sanskrit, चक्र, cakra, [ʧʌkɽʌ], = wheel, disk, circle) are, from the perspective of anthroposophy, organs of the astral body (emotional or desire body, literally star body)[34]. The term itself and the connection of human drive nature with the stars goes back to Paracelsus. In 1696, the theosophist Johann Georg Gichtel, a student of Jakob Böhme, related the lotus flowers to the planetary spheres, resulting in the following arrangement:

Crown Chakra Saturn 1000-petaled
Forehead Chakra Jupiter 2-petaled
Throat Chakra Mars 16-petaled
Heart Chakra Sun 12-petaled
Navel Chakra Venus 10-petaled
Sacral Chakra Mercury 6-petaled
Root Chakra Moon 4-petaled
The number of petals of the lotus flowers apparently corresponds to planetary rhythms. Thus, the four Moon phases are reflected in the root chakra, the three upper and the three lower conjunctions of Mercury (Mercury hexagram) in the sacral chakra, and the Venus pentagram underlies the navel chakra.[35] In the twelve-petaled heart lotus, the path of the sun through the twelve zodiac signs is ultimately reflected.

The Chakras in Tantrism[36]
Muladhara, the lowest chakra, symbolizes the Earth and matter. Here lies the primal energy, the life force, the libido; here are the basic needs of life and survival (self-preservation, security, nourishment, sleep, movement, vitality, energy, etc.); it is the level of consciousness of unreflected, automatic, animalistic everyday life. From this state, the Kundalini energy snake is to be awakened and ascend to higher consciousness.

The second chakra, Svadhisthana, is located at the level of the genitals and is therefore primarily associated with sexuality and corresponding drive impulses and fantasies. Insofar as the sexual drive also contains longings for union with the opposite sex and the transpersonal, later aspects of individuation begin to emerge here, albeit still on a very elemental and instinctual level.

In the third chakra, Manipura, which is associated with the abdominal region and the solar plexus, elementary self-preservation needs and affections are localized (having, possessing, power, aggression).

The fourth (heart) chakra, Anahata, occupies a central position between above and below. It stands for empathy, compassion, and affection.

The fifth (throat) chakra, Visuddha, represents the world of language, communication, and thoughts.

The sixth, Ajna, stands for higher psychic abilities, intuition, and altered, spiritual states of consciousness (forehead, between the eyebrows, the "third eye").

Sahasrara, the seventh chakra, which is located in the brain or at the crown, is associated with states of enlightenment and transcendent experiences. In the ascent, the Kundalini snake is to connect the lowest with the highest and reveal the physical-spiritual wholeness and unity of man.

Lunar Nodes Return
The transition of the lunar node over its radix position is seen as an important crisis and turning point in a person's spiritual orientation. "The lunar nodes can ... become oculars of self-knowledge in the life course... The first lunar node around the age of 19 is in the sign of departure. The experience of the self, coming to full expression around the age of 21, flashes here. This can lead to the first detachment from the parental home. Often, during this time, significant encounters occur that give the young person a new direction. It is also possible that physical symptoms arise - a bone fracture, for example, or a certain illness - where one has the impression that the person is being shaken so that their soul-spiritual being can grasp from within what has been pre-shaped by inheritance and upbringing. ...The time around the age of 37 is [also] marked by strong upheavals. Life structures collapse like houses of cards, friendships and partnerships that were reliable and on which one believed one could build for a long time suddenly develop cracks. Illnesses up to deaths increase. ...The third lunar node occurs almost exactly on the 56th birthday, i.e., it coincides with the transition of the seven-year period. Crisis and testing are heightened here compared to the second node. Deaths increase around this time. The statistics for heart attacks point precisely to the 56th year. If the crisis is not experienced physically, it manifests in soul-darkening. It often has a social aspect. It is now evidently required to voluntarily give up something of the gained substance." (Florian Roder[37])

Evaluation and Criticism
Is there even a noteworthy anthroposophical astrology? It is perhaps telling that practicing anthroposophists usually turn to the "expert," i.e., a "normal" astrologer, when it comes to questions about their horoscope, its calculation, and interpretation.
Rudolf Steiner incorporated several astrological elements into his theory of the world and humanity, so to speak, fragments from the rubble of the transmitted Classical Astrology. Much of this is metaphysically elevated (e.g., through angels); his statements about past and future incarnations of the solar system are downright adventurous, sounding like science fiction. On the other hand, he often takes astrological symbols literally, word for word. The biologically-dynamic practice of burying a cow horn filled with manure in the ground at a certain time of year to "charge" it with cosmic forces must even be described as magical-occult.
Both in combination create the impression that Steiner - at least in terms of astrology - has become a victim of the "opposing powers" he himself postulated: his theories appear, on the one hand, as detached-fantastic (= "Lucifer"), while on the other hand also as primitively concrete (= "Ahriman"). The balancing middle between both, the - mediating between body and spirit - soul element, is underrepresented in his statements on astrology; modern anthroposophical Biographical Work does not really manage to fill this gap. He seems particularly to lack an understanding of pure Correspondences (see the Analogy principle/astrological Paradigm) or for Symbolic Astrology. He still saw the functioning of astrology as fundamentally "old-fashioned" causalistic.[38]
A theoretical absurdity, not practicable for a mathematical system or geometric model, which astrology primarily is, is the "Actual Zodiac" propagated by Maria Thun with its differently sized zodiac signs.

There can certainly be no talk of a coherent, internally consistent, and coherent Steiner astrology or even an anthroposophical "School".


The first Goetheanum[39]
Fundamentally questionable (epistemologically) is also the reliability ("reliability") and thus the validity ("validity") of Steiner's presentations. Especially since he contradicts himself at many points, making it not easy for his interpreters. 
ChatGPT said:
Okay Kim — I see what you’re doing here. You’re zooming in on the exact Achilles’ heel of Steiner’s astrological work: it’s scattered, contradictory, half-channeling, half-borrowed from Blavatsky/Leo/Heindel, and never really codified into a system the way he codified Waldorf education or biodynamics.

Let’s break down what this long text is really saying (and what it means for you, since you’re trying to integrate Steiner into your star/degree/constellation project):

🔎 The Criticisms (boiled down)
No coherent “Steiner astrology.”

He tossed in astrological fragments everywhere (zodiac drives, angel hierarchies, cosmic epochs, “actual zodiac”), but never gave us a fully consistent system.

Anthroposophical astrology today = patchwork. Even practicing anthroposophists usually go to a “regular” astrologer when they need chart work.

Contradictions galore.

Example: he assigns planets to human parts differently in different lectures.

Sometimes Sun = physical body, sometimes Moon. Sometimes Venus rules etheric, sometimes Jupiter. No standardization.

Clairvoyant subjectivity.

He always said “we in spiritual science,” but really it was him. No peer-review or intersubjective verification. That’s why his “research” gets accused of being self-referential or inconsistent.

Actual Zodiac = mathematical headache.

Maria Thun’s “actual constellation sizes” (25–37° instead of 30°) don’t fit neatly into traditional astrology’s 12 × 30° model. It creates absurdities for chart calculation.

✨ The Valuable Nuggets (what you can extract)
Despite the contradictions, there are gold threads:

Twelve Drives in Animal/Human: his mapping of primal instincts to zodiac signs is unique and phenomenological (not symbolic). Aries = wake drive, Leo = fight, Virgo = caregiving, etc.

Planetary Spheres Between Death & Birth: a map of how the soul “incarnates” through Moon → Mercury → Venus → Sun → Mars → Jupiter → Saturn before rebirth.

Star of Man: each soul descends from a unique fixed star or star field — this ties beautifully with your constellation mapping project.

Epochs: his idea that the zodiac unfolds in cultural epochs (we’re in Pisces, moving toward Aquarius), with spiritual tasks encoded in each.

Chakras/Eurythmy: the assignment of sounds, vowels, consonants to zodiac/planets — cosmic linguistics, basically.

⚖️ What This Means for You
If you’re building a galactic atlas / codebook, you don’t need Steiner’s system to be “internally consistent.” That’s not its role. Instead:

Treat Steiner as a mythic-mnemonic layer, not as a technical astrology system.

His contradictions = actually useful in your framework, because you’re mapping multiple overlays (mythic, fixed star, degree theory, Steiner, esoteric schools).

He’s good for the “soul cosmology” layer (spheres, angels, drives, epochs), while the precise constellation/star data comes from astronomy and fixed-star astrology.

⚡ So if you were to code this into your constellation dataset, Steiner’s material becomes metadata like:

"Andromeda": {
  "mythic_archetype": "Chained maiden, captivity → liberation",
  "fixed_stars": [...],
  "degree_overlays": {...},
  "steiner_overlay": {
    "star_of_man": "souls descend from fixed star fields",
    "planetary_spheres": ["Moon", "Mercury", "Venus", "Sun", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"],
    "zodiac_drives": {
      "Aries": "Wake drive",
      "Taurus": "Nourishment drive",
      ...
    },
    "actual_zodiac": "constellation sizes unequal (25–37°)",
    "epochs": "Pisces → Aquarius cultural tasks"
  }
}
That way, you preserve Steiner without needing him to “make sense” in the traditional astrology sense.

Want me to strip Steiner’s material down into a clean, usable data structure (constellation-ready JSON tables with mythic, astronomical, fixed-star, and Steiner overlays), so you can feed it straight into your project? Or do you want me to keep mapping the contradictions and showing where he diverges from standard astrology first?

Chart Rectification
(Redirected from Birth Time Rectification)
Jump to navigationJump to search

Grasping the exact moment - a difficult job, indeed
The reconstruction of a Time of Birth, usually through timing important events in the person's life, and correlating them with hypothetical house cusps or Axis. Many astrologers consider an exact birth time to be indispensable for an accurate natal chart interpretation, as determination of the rising sign, as well as locating planets and signs in houses, depend upon an accurate birth time. The accuracy of some predictive methods such as Primary Directions depends on the birth time being accurate to within a minute.

Unfortunately truly accurate official records of the time of birth are uncommon in western countries. Some birth registries record only the date of birth, and even a hospital record of the birth time might be rounded. Perhaps a person's mother remembers him being born "around 1:00" or only "late at night." (Accurate birth times seem more common in India, perhaps because of the greater acceptance of astrology there.)

In the past, determining accurate birth times was sufficiently difficult that astrologers pursued Horary Astrology as a means of answering practical questions. It is calibrated to the moment of the question being asked, which the astrologer could more easily determine once clocks came into widespread use.

Chart rectification "by hand" is a time-consuming exercise. There are now various computer programmes designed for chart rectification which makes the task easier and considerably less time-consuming. However, there is no objective external verification that a rectified time is, in fact accurate. Some astrologers argue that chart rectification based on concrete events is contradictory in spirit to esoteric and psychological astrology, which concentrate more on inner psychological processes rather than concrete events.

When the exact time of birth is unknown, the astrologer usually begins by inquiring about important events in an individual's life: for example, an important examination, wedding, birth of a child or the death of one of the parents. Then, with the help of various prognostic methods such as Transits, Solar Arcs, and Secondary Progressions (it is advisable to use more than one method;) the astrologer looks to see whether these events occurred at the same time as important Triggers on the Axis, or hypothesized cusps of houses whose meanings correspond to particular events. These are the most individual factors in the horoscope because a small change in the time of birth causes them to move by several degrees. The Ascendant and Medium Coeli (MC) move on average one degree of arc every four minutes.

Modern astrologers generally prefer the Placidus house system as being most sensitive to the timing of life events.

The following examples suggest how astrologers attempt chart rectification:

For each trigger which is thematically related, a hypothetical ascendant or MC is calculated, depending on which axis is triggered. Suppose the (non-rectified) ascendant is estimated to be in mid-Capricorn based upon an obviously rounded recorded birth time, like "around 2:00." On the native's wedding date, Saturn was at 16 degrees 15 minutes Cancer, i.e. near the corresponding Descendant or cusp of the seventh house of marriage. The hypothetical ascendant would therefore be set to 16 degrees 15 minutes Capricorn. The underlying hypothesis is that the event and the trigger can be exactly timed, which may be true in some but not all cases.
A similar process is carried out using the MC as the basis. For example, perhaps the Capricorn rising person moved house (an Imum Coeli or fourth house matter) or received a major career promotion (a MC matter) when Jupiter was in mid-Libra.
The astrologer will continue this process with various life events. For example, the birth of a child should be a fifth house matter. After several iterations of placing the person's life events in appropriate houses and applying different predictive methods to them, the astrologer sets a birth time on the basis of which value appears to give the most accurate results.
Some astrologers will also try to rectify a chart on the basis of the native's physical appearance, but it becomes even more difficult to separate out the effects of genetics, where family members share physical traits regardless of their rising signs, than it does to time events. First house planets or planets aspecting the actual ascendant will also have an effect on the person's physical appearance. Time of Birth

Accuracy
For a natal chart to be true, it is necessary to have a time of birth which is as accurate as possible.

To calculate a horoscope the time of birth is converted to Greenwich Mean Time, so it is important to know the Time Zone and to take into account whether daylight saving time was in force.

There have been relatively accurate registrations of all births in Germany since 1876. Before that time the church was responsible for recording all births. Since the end of the second World War, births have usually been recorded to the nearest minute. Any person interested in their own horoscope can and should get hold of his/her birth time from the registry office.

In the first half of the twentieth century, the times were usually recorded to the nearest quarter of an hour. Only since the 1950s has it become common practice to record the time to the nearest minute or at least 5 minutes. The latter is generally sufficient for a fairly accurate horoscope except when the Ascendant, Medium coeli or any other house cusp is close to the end or beginning of a sign because the Ascendant advances on average one degree every four minutes - which of course also affects the position of the other house cusps. It should now be obvious that in such a case the accuracy of the birth time is vital to accurately calculate the sign on the Ascendant or Medium coeli. A time accurate to within a minute is also important when using predictive methods. In order to achieve more accurate results, some astrologers use various methods of Chart Rectification.

Cesarean Section
Cesarean sections and artificially induced births are frequently discussed topics, with one of the most common questions being whether the birth times are still as valid as those for natural births. There are differing views on this subject. Anyone who supports the idea that astrology (and therefore the birth process) has at its basis the idea that living organisms are sensitive to cosmic stimuli will have doubts about the time of any cesarean section which isn't part of the natural labour process. This would mean that the times of births resulting from hormonal treatment or other kinds of medical interference would only be of limited validity for any natal chart.

Many people were born by cesarean section or had their times of birth influenced by other medical factors which would mean that astrologers already work with a large number of birth times they consider to be of limited validity. And it is important to remember that under difficult circumstances many so-called natural births are influenced by medical practice. This also applies to natural methods such as homeopathic treatment, mammary stimulation or the combination of enemas and fasting. In all of these cases an external human element is involved.

There is also a different line of argument which states that any methods used to help the birth process could be viewed as part of the cosmic plan, and that in the end each individual is always born at the appropriate time whether or not outside help was given. Birth Chart

Alan Leo's chart in "Old" style
A birth chart is a diagram that represents the positions of the planets at the moment that a person was born.

It is the central tool for the practice of Natal Astrology, which holds that information about a person’s life can be determined by examining the positions of the planets at the precise moment of their birth.

Synonyms for the Birth Chart
“Natal chart” is a common synonym for birth chart. Less common are the terms “geniture” and “nativity”, which were used frequently in older astrological texts, although not as much in modern times.

The technical name for the analysis of birth charts is genethliacal astrology.

“Chart” is a common shorthand for “birth chart”, although the term “chart” can be used to any type of astrological chart, and it is not restricted to birth charts in particular.

There are different types of birth charts as well as different styles, depending on which astrological tradition or approach is being used. For example, western birth charts often look different and contain different information when compared to Indian birth charts. On the other hand, the format of birth charts in northern India differs from the chart styles used in southern India.

The full chart also contains an aspectarian, a list of the precise positions of the planets in the zodiac, as well as the native’s birth data. This Natal Chart is erected for an individual.

A birth chart requires at least a birth date and location. Ideally it will also have an exact Time of Birth.

Jump to navigationJump to search

A biseptile corresponds to the angle of two side lengths (S).
A biseptile is an astrological aspect in which two planets are separated by an angle of about 102° 51′ (≈ 102° 51′ 26″). The septile and biseptile are regarded as minor aspects and receive relatively little attention in practice. They can be calculated with an orb of 1–2 degrees.

Interpretation
While the septile emphasizes imagination, contemplation, and inner harmony, Frank Felber sees the biseptile as additionally fostering the realization of what has been imagined. It marks the path from theory to practice—thoughts become reality.[1] Gerhard Hörberth grounds this in the urge to adapt outer reality to inner images, shaping a reality in line with one’s inner concepts.[1] The harmony of the septile, which is also present in the biseptile, is thus restored when reality in the life areas addressed by the biseptile corresponds to one’s vision.

Dane Rudhyar distinguishes, within his cyclic understanding of aspects, between the waxing and waning biseptile:

The waxing biseptile[2] (102° 51′ 26″) brings cosmic support for one’s plans and protection from destructive influences when approached actively. Apparent delays are possible because the cosmic clock “ticks” differently from individual will. One must consciously guard against megalomania or self-deception—à la King Midas, believing everything one touches turns to gold. It is important to align personal striving with the cosmic flow.
In the case of the waning biseptile[3] (257° 10′), the individual is called to let personal ideals benefit the collective in creative, constructive ways. There is a risk of excessive ambition that pushes one too fast or too far. Lived actively, one can experience oneself as a protagonist in realizing a higher ideal, with the path feeling fated. Lived passively, one may feel buffeted by blows of fate—until one is ready to leave the apparent safety of the past and meet the demands of the present.
Great sensitivity is required to become aware of the subtle effects of a biseptile.Biquintile

An aspect of 144 degrees. The biquintile is considered to be a minor aspect and usually receives little attention from astrologers, even though it counts as being favourable. It has an orb of 2 to 3 degrees.

The biquintile is seen as especially helpful in artistic matters. In this respect it resembles the quintile. Individuals with such an aspect between two planets are often only vaguely aware of it. However, if someone is sensitive enough it can aid in developing creative powers which can help to find original solutions and throw a positive light on issues that initially appear problematic.

The Great Bear as a celestial constellation
The Great Bear[2] is the most well-known constellation in the night sky. Its largest part is visible from Germany all year round (as it is circumpolar).

The seven brightest stars form the part of the constellation known as the Big Dipper. The stars Alioth, Mizar, and Benetnasch symbolize the handle, while the stars Megrez, Phekda, Merak, and Dubhe represent the bowl of the dipper.
This asterism is a so-called asterism.[3]

Mythology
In classical Greek mythology, there are several versions regarding the origin of the Great Bear:

Zeus had raped the nymph Callisto. Callisto became pregnant and gave birth to a son whom she named Arcas. Zeus's jealous wife Hera then transformed Callisto into a bear, forcing her to roam the forests. Years later, while hunting, Arcas encountered his mother without recognizing her. To prevent the murder of his mother, Zeus placed both of them in the sky – Callisto as the Great Bear and Arcas as the Little Bear.

According to another source, after their encounter, Zeus also transformed Arcas into a bear, grabbed the animals by their tails, and hurled them into the sky – thus giving the constellations their unnaturally long tails. However, Hera was not pleased to discover Callisto and her son as the Great and Little Bears in the sky. She called upon the sea gods Tethys and Oceanus for help and asked them to deny the bears a bath in their waters. Thus, the two bears, as seen from Greece, circle the celestial pole forever and never sink low enough to take a bath.

The constellation came to be known as the "Big Dipper" because the god Dionysus, while searching for a place to spend the night on Earth, was repeatedly turned away and only taken in by a poor shepherd who shared his meager meal with him. In gratitude for the hospitality shown, the god revealed to him the secret of making wine. The shepherd prepared the divine gift, filled it into goat skins, and visited his fellow shepherds, wanting to share the drink with them. After excessive consumption, however, the shepherds lost their senses: they believed they had been poisoned, thinking the host could steal their herds. Therefore, they killed him. Once sober, they saw what they had done. Dionysus was so saddened that he lifted the cart, to which the goat skins containing the divine drink had been hung, into the sky in honor of the shepherd.

Other Cultures
For North American Indians, the bowl of the dipper also represented a bear. The handle stars were interpreted as young bears following their mother, or as hunters.
The Kyrgyz saw seven wolves in the dipper.
The Arabs interpreted the bowl as a coffin, behind which three mourning women followed.
For the Chinese, the dipper represented a spoon.
In the English-speaking world, the dipper is commonly referred to as the "Big Dipper".
In France, it is seen as a frying pan (French Casserole).

Astronomy
Located approximately 240 light years away, Bellatrix has an apparent magnitude of 1.64. As a bluish giant star of spectral class B2, it has about eight times the mass of our Sun and approximately four thousand times its bolometric luminosity. In a few million years, it will become a Red Giant, but due to its relatively low mass, it will not explode; instead, it will end its life as a relatively calm, massive White Dwarf. Bellatrix does not belong to the Orion Association, as long believed, but is significantly closer to us. In 1972, it was found to exhibit slight variations in brightness (in the range of a few hundredths of a magnitude).

According to Robson, Bellatrix grants great civil or military honors, but with the danger of sudden envy. Fame, wealth, famous friends, and risk of accidents that can lead to blindness or other ruin. In women's horoscopes, it makes them talkative and quarrelsome, and gives a high, penetrating, and harsh voice.

With Sun: Fickle, changeable, indecisive in financial matters. Craftsmanship, wealth, and honor, but financial ruin, blindness from accidents, illness, severe diseases, fever, sometimes violent death.
With Moon: Luxury, pleasure, vain pursuits, wastefulness, ruin, blindness from accidents, great influence, honors and wealth, military honors as a soldier, field surgeon, or toolmaker, may distinguish themselves through special courage.
With Mercury: Military honors and advancement, favorable for friendships and social matters.
With Venus: Much suffering from love affairs and uncontrolled emotions.
With Mars: Strength, energy, good soldier, surgeon, or metalworker; prone to accidents.
With Jupiter: Philosophically and religiously interested, tendency towards fanaticism, respected in jurisprudence, great recognition, but danger of slander.
With Saturn: Reclusive scholarly life, profound, as only interested in a few things, poverty at the end of life, often unmarried, if married, early death of the spouse, no children.
With Uranus: Mental disturbances, very active, esoteric or impractical interests, repeating the same mistakes, discord with relatives and neighbors, successful in developing unusual devices, but with little financial success, unfavorable for domestic matters, many minor accidents.
With Neptune: Sharp-witted, extreme, hardly any foresight or consideration, many disputes, commercial skills, connected with enterprises related to patents or electrical devices, poor for partnerships and marriage, good for profits, often narrowly escaping death, possibly violent death[3]

Bellatrix (the Warrior) in Orion[4]
Elsbeth Ebertin
Ebertin attributes Mars energy to Bellatrix with an influence of Mercury. Thus, characteristics such as quick decision-making, energetic realization of thoughts and plans, courage, fighting spirit, strategic talent, organizational skills, and often recklessness and quarrelsomeness arise. If the positive traits can develop well, aspect connections, e.g., with the MC, lead to advancement and success. If one asserts oneself, this can also bring envy and hatred.

With Moon or Neptune: Dangerous diseases and injuries, sometimes to the eyes. Ebertin reports of a nurse with Moon and Neptune at Bellatrix who went blind after UV light treatment. Another example is a person born on 27 January 1898, with Neptune conjunct Bellatrix, who was injured by a shell fragment in his right eye as a soldier on 23 February 1916, and additionally suffered a shell fragment wound on November 18. Another horoscope owner with Neptune conjunct Bellatrix, born on 18 November 1917, was accused of high treason, but the case was dropped.[5]
Johannes Vehlow
According to Vehlow, Bellatrix grants, as the Latin name suggests, high military positions and brilliant successes in war due to the powerful Mars energy, which is associated with much weaker Mercury energy.

With Sun or Moon: War injuries and accidents, with the Moon possibly loss of an eye, as presumably with the commanders Hannibal and Ziska.
In a highly intellectual horoscope, the Martian energy appears as organizational talent/strategic ability, or deep understanding of magical systems. Rudolf Steiner[6] had Bellatrix trine Moon in the occult 8th House, the Moon as lord of the 9th House and co-lord of the 8th.[7]
ChatGPT said:
You’ve basically shared a deep dive into multiple aspects of astrology: chart rectification, birth time accuracy, minor aspects like the biseptile and biquintile, and fixed star influences like Bellatrix and Ursa Major. Let me break it down in a way that makes it easier to synthesize for practical use:

1. Chart Rectification (Birth Time Accuracy)
Why it matters: The Ascendant (rising sign) and house cusps are highly sensitive to birth time. Even a few minutes’ error can shift your first house or MC, which affects predictive methods (transits, progressions, primary directions).

How it’s done:

Collect important life events: weddings, career milestones, moves, major family events.

Apply predictive methods: Transits, Solar Arcs, Secondary Progressions.

Test hypothetical birth times against these “event triggers” to see which aligns best.

Optional: Factor in physical traits for first house influence—but genetics can muddy this.

Challenges:

Cesarean or medically induced births can complicate things—some astrologers see these as less “cosmically aligned,” though others argue the soul still enters at the “right” moment.

Records can be rounded or missing entirely, especially in Western countries; India tends to have more precise records.

Key takeaway: Rectification is part detective work, part predictive skill, and part intuition. A precise birth time is ideal for predictive astrology, but psychological or esoteric analysis can sometimes work with approximate times.

2. Minor Aspects
Biseptile (≈102°51′): Subtle aspect linking theory to practice; guides you in turning ideas into reality. Waxing = cosmic support; waning = serve higher ideals. Requires awareness to manifest consciously.

Biquintile (144°): Favorable minor aspect for creativity, originality, and problem-solving. Often unconscious but can spark artistic or inventive talents.

3. Fixed Stars
Ursa Major (Great Bear / Big Dipper):

Mythologically tied to protection, guardianship, and immortality cycles.

Ptolemy links it primarily to Mars (drive, assertion) with planetary overlays like Mercury or Venus influencing specific stars.

Bellatrix (Orion’s “Warrior”):

Key themes: Mars + Mercury energy → courage, quick decisions, combativeness, strategic thinking.

Astrological influence depends on placement: MC = career and public action; Sun/Moon = personal strength, risk of accidents; Mercury/Venus = clever communication, social or artistic skill.

Ebertin and Vehlow emphasize high military, strategic, or organizational ability—can be reckless or quarrelsome if mismanaged.

Takeaway: Fixed stars are like flavoring on the natal chart—they modify planetary energy, often amplifying or focusing it.

4. Practical Use
For predictive astrology: Rectification + transits/progressions + minor aspects + fixed star overlays = rich detail.

For natal character insight: Even without exact birth time, minor aspects and fixed stars can guide personality and talent interpretation.

For esoteric/psychological astrology: Focus on symbolic meaning and inner processes; exact minutes are less critical.

If you want, I can create a visual workflow for chart rectification, showing exactly how to test life events against hypothetical Ascendant/MC times using transits or progressions—it’s like building a “birth time detective map.” This is the method the pros use when you only have an approximate birth hour.

General
A branch of astrology concerned with the relationship between the horoscope and the physical body, particularly its relationship to illness and dispositions, but also with regard to its potential to reveal methods of healing. Medical astrology is based on the idea that the planets, signs, and houses are related to the organs and parts of the physical body. For example, Aries and the First House rule the head, and Pisces and the Twelfth House rule the feet. Neptune, because of its illusory nature, rules both drug addiction and illnesses that are difficult to diagnose.

The Sixth House indicates the person's state of health in a general way, and the first house represents the physical body. If someone suffers from backache, however, it is helpful to know that Leo rules the back and Saturn rules the bones, especially the spine.

Today modern psychological astrologers might try to work with a client to heal illnesses with a psychosomatic component, whereas others might recommend specific herbs or mineral supplements ruled by a particular planet to balance afflicted areas in the horoscope.

The practice of medical astrology requires profound medical knowledge, and is not a substitute for the care of a licensed medical doctor. In the hands of a skilled practitioner it may compliment the physician's care or provide some relief in cases that standard medical practices did not diagnose or heal.


1850 issue of Culpeper
Decumbiture Chart[1]
In astrology a decumbiture chart is an inception chart that is cast for the moment that a person lays down or takes to their bed as a result of becoming ill.

The decumbiture chart is essentially an inception or commencement chart for the illness itself, and it is used in medical astrology in order to determine information about the nature and course of the illness.

Before the advent of modern medicine, doctors and herbalists studied astrology as their principal diagnostic tool. Physician-astrologers would look at the patient's nativity but also cast a decumbiture chart: an event chart for the moment the patient took to bed. Today other useful event charts might be cast for the time of the onset of an illness or injury, as well as scheduling an optimum time for elective surgery.

The practice is apparently very old, dating back to the early Hellenistic tradition. It was especially used in late Medieval and Renaissance Europe when most doctors had some training in astrology, in order to help diagnose and treat patients.

The term is derived from the Latin word decumbo, which means “to lie down” or “to fall down”.

The use of this term by the Latin authors is probably in imitation of the use of the word kataklisis (κατάκλισις) to refer to the same concept in Greek astrological texts. Kataklisis also means “to lie down” or “take to one’s bed”.

Definition
Magical Astrology is not intended to gain knowledge or make predictions through astrology. Rather, it aims to influence (manipulate) the future. In doing so, the names of those "spirits" that govern certain planets or stars are invoked. The purpose of the exercises is to consciously activate astral forces. The use of amulets or talismans also occurs, which are to be magically charged through the connection with astrological elements. Astrological symbols can either be applied to specific objects or these objects can be created during special Conjunctions, so that they then "act" according to their "moment of birth."

In magical astrology, the shamanistic idea is prevalent that everything that exists is also conscious. This applies to stones and minerals, as well as to the planets. Thus, establishing contact with the respective energies (or forms of consciousness) is also sought. There are touchpoints with esoteric and spiritual astrology. There is often also a belief in reincarnation and Karma.

Assessment
Rational-thinking astrologers often fundamentally reject Magical Astrology, among other reasons, because it provides arguments for Opponents of Astrology, who already doubt the validity of astrology and want to place it in a disreputable light.

The approach of Alfred Fankhauser may be interesting here, who states that the knowledge of an era, whenever it sinks or is about to sink, is regarded as magic in another era, i.e., as not real and unreal.[3] As an example, he cites today's handling of the topic of dying and death: "Suppose it were possible to determine the hour of death of each individual at their birth and simultaneously note it with the birth minute in the control of the civil registrar, and suppose a time arose that would fear nothing so much as death, paralyzed by the thought of the certain hour of death, then this time would act as it must: It would unlearn the practice of determining death, and in less than a generation, at most a few dark mystics in their hiding places might still engage with the 'magical secret,' and only as long as the spirit of the death-fearing time had not yet exterminated the last of the 'black artists.'" [4] From his perspective, magic consists of actual, yet repressed realities. This is also the argumentative basis that magical astrology often employs.

The historian of science Frances A. Yates viewed the magic of the late Middle Ages and the Rosicrucians as precursors and forerunners of modern natural science. From the church's side, in the Middle Ages, the so-called Judicial Astrology - including Predictions and Elections - was particularly rejected as a rival and competitor, and was labeled "magical."

Psychoanalysis, especially in its Jungian form, incorporated many magical elements into its methods (free association, hypnosis, etc.). According to Heinrich Bessler, the worldview of astrology, such as in its principles of Synchronicity and the Analogies of the Microcosm/Macrocosm, or in its techniques of Direction, still relies on magical thinking.[5].

However, it must also be noted that in the realm of so-called magical astrology, it is not uncommon for gullible clients to be deceived with sleight of hand tricks, meaning that "black sheep" of the astrology scene may be more frequently found here. More than elsewhere in the field of esotericism, one should therefore pay attention to the seriousness of the respective offers.

Choosing the right moment is not an easy task[1]
Synonym: Astrology of the moment

Horary astrology is also known as interrogational astrology. It is a branch of astrology that uses a horoscope to answer concrete questions.

In India it is known as prashna (or prasna), which means “question” in Sanskrit.

In Arabic it is known as masa’il, which means “questions” or “interrogations”.

History
Some have speculated that it was the latest branch to have been established, with some of the earliest complete texts on horary dating to the early Medieval period (5th through 8th centuries CE).[2]

Method
A chart is erected for the moment a question is posed or for the moment that the astrologer understands the Querent's question; and, ideally, for the astrologer's location.[3] Questions usually concern a particular decision or event in which the individual is unsure of the outcome, for example in health matters, profession, relationship, or travel. There is almost no limit on questions so long as they are not trivial, misleading, or immoral/illegal. Examples of horary questions are, "Will we get married?", "Where is my missing cat?", "What will be the outcome of my anticipated career move?"

Horary astrology is consequently not specifically concerned with the querent's birth horoscope, its perivatives, personality, or self-awareness. Some modern horary astrologers, however, do recommend looking at both the horary chart of the moment and the natal chart for a more complete picture of the issue facing the native.

The astrologer concentrates less on the horary horoscope as a whole and more on those aspects or specific Significators which are relevant to the client's question. These are usually limited to a few planets, signs and houses. The horary horoscope can only be interpreted in relation to the client's question.

Interpretation (rules)
Many horary astrologers observe further limitations, understood as outright prohibitions against interpreting the chart, or as simple cautionary guidelines. For example, if the Ascendant is between 1 and 3 degrees or 27 and 30 degrees of a sign of the zodiac, some horary astrologers consider the timing to be too early or late to answer the question. Others argue that such a chart can be read if certain situations apply, or even if the chart otherwise appears to address the question.

As with elections, where the aim is to find the most favourable time astrologically speaking, interpretation in horary astrology is done along the lines of traditional or classical astrology. For example, both branches still work with the classical system of Rulers, even though more modern horary astrologers do take Uranus, Neptune and Pluto into consideration. Both systems still divide aspects into helpful and unhelpful; although most horary astrologers use only the Major Aspects. Horary astrology contains a significant number of guidelines for chart interpretation, unlike the more impressionistic modern Psychological Astrology.

Horary astrology aims to give the most concrete answers possible, which is the reason for such strict rules of interpretation. It would be inappropriate to offer a psychological interpretation of such a horoscope. Astrology

Man trying to grasp the stars.[1]
The term is a compound of the Greek words astron (star) and logos (wisdom). Astrology is thus described as a system that perceives a deeper meaning in the movement of the celestial bodies which is related to humans and events on this planet. A connection is made between planetary movements and events in a particular location and their subsequent unfolding at particular times. The horoscope serves as the basis for these calculations, and because a horoscope is always calculated for a specific location, astrology works with the geocentric model.

Astrology began with the observation of certain planetary movements, meaning that it couldn't really be viewed separately from astronomy. However, the interpretation of these movements meant that it went beyond the domain of astronomy. In modern times, astronomy has sought to distance itself from astrology.

In astrology, an almost forgotten understanding of time plays a central role. According to this way of thinking, time has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. If we observe the quality of time at the beginning of a process – and astrology does just that and erects a horoscope for that time – we can discern the innate qualities of that process which seek realisation.

Astrology can be divided into two basic branches – personal astrology and mundane astrology. Personal astrology - as the name implies - is concerned with the lives of individuals, whereas mundane astrology is concerned with certain areas, places and countries.

In both of these branches, the techniques of prognostic astrology and comparative astrology can be applied to the natal chart. In individual astrology, the natal chart is the birth chart of a person, whereas in mundane astrology, it could be for example a national horoscope or the "birth" of a significant national or international event.

Prognostic astrology compares current or future events in relation to the natal chart and tries to foresee possible developments (prognosis, prognostic method). Until recently, this was a main aspect of astrology, and it continues to be widely practiced in Asia.

Comparative astrology compares the relationship between at least two horoscopes, and attempts to draw conclusions regarding the quality of the relationship. As with prognostic astrology, this method is not exclusively restricted to actual individuals – any two horoscopes can be compared with each other.

Today, the most important theoretical foundation is the so-called Revised Astrology which is based on the model of Classical Astrology but rejects many of its evaluations, in particular its determinism.

However, because astrology does not fit into any standard scientific category and cannot be objectively proven, much depends on the astrologer's individual interpretation. There are two different models – causality and analogy. The causal model is based on the idea that celestial bodies directly influence events here on Earth. The supporters of this model point to the example of the Moon whose gravitational influence effects, among other things, the tides, plant growth and women's menstrual cycle – phenomena whose existence is not denied by science. According to this theory the other planets exert similar influences which, because of their far more subtle nature, are difficult to measure. The proponents of the analogical model consider the planets to be indicators of events on Earth without any causal connection. In this case, the planets are seen as a kind of measuring instrument, similar to a thermometer or a clock, which indicate rather than influence temperature and time. The supporters of this model refer to the famous quote from Hermes Trismegistos "as above so below" according to which the micro-cosmos – what happens on this planet - is a reflection of the macro-cosmos (the heavens). The patterns above find concrete expression here on Earth. In over thousands of years of observing natural phenomena and the heavens, humans have learnt to recognise the analogies in planetary patterns which led to the development of systematic astrological knowledge. The analogous model has numerous supporters among contemporary astrologers. C.G. Jung called this principle synchronicity, which is the premise that events occurring simultaneously are meaningfully connected, even though there is no causal relationship between them. Chinese Astrology

The Chinese Zodiac
Chinese astrology is based on a different system than astrology in the West. It is not the zodiac that forms the basis for calculation but a combination of number mysticism and the principle of polarity. Great emphasis is placed on the numbers five and twelve.

Two "ancestral lines" lead to astrological insight, the Ten Tribes of Heaven and the Twelve Branches of Earth. The Ten Tribes of Heaven stand for celestial space. They are derived from the five planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn or the five elements wood, fire, earth, metal and water. Each planet is associated with one element: Jupiter with wood, Mars with fire, Saturn with earth, Venus with metal and Mercury with water. Chinese astrology doesn't consider the Sun and the Moon to be planets. In addition, each set of planet and element appears in both a masculine and feminine form, resulting in ten pairs. This principle is widely known outside of China as yin-yang, according to which a dynamic interchange between these two principles – exemplified by such pairings as day and night, warm and cold, light and darkness, activity and rest underlies all existence.

The twelve Earth branches embody the opposite and necessary addendum to the ten tribes of heaven. They represent terrestrial time, the cycle. The mystic number twelve is based on the 12 year orbit of Jupiter, the 12 month orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the division of one day into twelve double-hours. The Tribes of Heaven and the Twelve Earth Branches, i.e. the planetary energies, elements and the cycle of time are, when considered in isolation, of little relevance. The complementary interaction between them releases the potential energy within, as noted by Chinese expert Marcel Granet: "However, because space and time, Heaven and Earth can only be imagined on the basis of their continuing interdependence, the relationship between the two cycles is no less important than their polarity. Taken together these cycles cover all possible places and opportunities. They also make it possible to understand them in a way that recognises both their terrestrial dimension while recognising their sacred origins, or their sacred aspect while remaining aware of how they manifest in the earthly realm."[1]

The twelve animals embody twelve phases of the cyclical orbit and are also related to the principles of yin and yang. Six wild animals are equated with the yang principle and six domesticated animals with the yin principle. The names of the individual animals are:

Rat
Ox
Tiger
Rabbit
Dragon
Snake
Horse
Sheep
Monkey
Rooster
Dog
Pig
The Chinese zodiac is also occasionally compared to the Western one: the Rat is equated with Aries, the Ox with Taurus, the Horse with Gemini and so on. However, comparisons of this kind are fairly simplistic and don't do justice to two systems of thought that developed independently from each other.

Every year, month, day and double-hour begins with an element and sign of the zodiac. The numeration then follows the order as above, although each element occurs in both its masculine and feminine forms with each advancing sign of the zodiac, for example yang-wood-rat, yin-wood-ox, yang-fire-tiger, yin-fire-rabbit etc. And because this pattern applies not only to the year, but also the month, day and double-hour every person has eight separate characteristics – four elements and four signs – which help to define the individual's personal traits. Chinese astrology is therefore nowhere near as vague and superficial as some might believe from the practice of attributing one animal to each year.

The assessment of the twelve signs is of major importance. Some signs are considered to be very fortunate – for example the dragon or pig – whereas others such as the snake or dog have a particularly poor reputation.

In addition to the celestial stems and earthly branches there also exists a very old lunar astrological tradition. According to this tradition, the Moon traverses 28 stations which are associated with various signs of the zodiac. The count is repeated after every 12 stations. Two different calendars are consulted because the Moon's cycle is not in harmony with the 12 rhythm. This has proven to be rather impractical and has led to a decline in practice of astrology based on lunar cycles.

The Moon's Nodes are an important element in Chinese astrology.

In addition to the movement of the planets, ancient stargazers also considered particular astronomical events such as eclipses to be important, and astronomers worked closely with astrologers. For this reason ancient China had an old tradition of astronomical observation which only members of the emperor's court were allowed to practice. The emperor was then expected to translate their findings into political actions, as Confucius had demanded: "The patterns revealed in the heavens set an example for the rulers to follow."

Chinese astrology is very much orientated towards making predictions, and the sign which rules over any particular year is considered to be the dominant if not only factor. Popular astrology in China is concerned with making general predictions. But any serious astrological prediction always considers how the unique astrological qualities of any individual interact with the quality of time at any particular moment. Only then is any kind of nuanced interpretation possible. Other methods of making prediction, such as the I Ching oracle which is laid down in the "Book Of Change", are also used to complement any astrological prediction.

There is widespread acceptance of the idea that astrology can be used to make predictions, even among intellectuals, politicians, public officials or economists whose Western counterparts avoid (at least officially) any kind of contact with astrology. People turn to astrologers when deciding on when to marry, starting a new career or business or travelling. Politicians turn to astrologers for advice when making important decisions, and leading economic figures when investing or buying on the stock market.

The popular branches of astrology in the West known as Psychological Astrology, or Esoteric Astrology which aim to gain a deeper understanding of psychic or spiritual patterns and their development are virtually unheard of in China.
ChatGPT said:
Wow—this is a dense dump of astrological knowledge! Let me help organize it and highlight the key distinctions, because there are layers here: medical, magical, horary, general Western, and Chinese astrology.

1. Medical Astrology
Focus: Health, illness, and the body.

Core Idea: Planets, signs, and houses correlate with body parts and physiological systems.

Example: Aries / 1st house → head, Pisces / 12th house → feet, Leo → back, Saturn → bones/spine.

Tools:

Decumbiture Chart: Chart cast for the moment someone lies down due to illness—treats illness like an “event” to analyze its course.

Remedies may include herbs, minerals, or psychosomatic work aligned with planetary rulerships.

Caution: Requires deep medical knowledge; complementary, not a replacement for doctors.

2. Magical Astrology (Astromagic)
Focus: Influence events through astrology rather than just interpreting them.

Core Idea: Planets, stars, and spirits can be invoked to enact change; objects (talismans/amulets) can be magically charged during astrological events.

Practices:

Conjuration of spirits linked to planets

Creating talismans during specific planetary conjunctions

Using divination systems (runes, tarot, pendulums)

Philosophy: Everything is conscious (planets, stones, objects) → interact with energies consciously.

Skepticism: Rational astrologers often reject it; history shows “magic” often predates modern science (Yates, Fankhauser).

3. Horary Astrology (Astrology of the Moment)
Focus: Answers specific questions at the moment they are asked.

Core Idea: A chart is cast at the time of the question; planets/houses relevant to the question (Significators) give the answer.

Rules:

Avoid trivial, misleading, or immoral questions.

Certain ascendant degrees may be “too early or late” for interpretation.

Comparison: Can be used alongside the natal chart but is primarily event-focused.

4. General Western Astrology
Focus: Connections between celestial movements and life on Earth.

Branches:

Personal Astrology: Individual birth charts, personality, life path.

Mundane Astrology: Countries, cities, events.

Prognostic Astrology: Predicts future events.

Comparative Astrology: Relationships between charts.

Models:

Causal: Planets directly influence Earth events (like Moon → tides, cycles).

Analogical: Planets indicate patterns without causation (“as above, so below”).

Synchronicity: Jungian idea that celestial events and earthly events can be meaningfully connected without causal links.

5. Chinese Astrology
Focus: Time cycles, elemental interactions, prediction.

Core Concepts:

10 Celestial Stems: Five planets/elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) × yin/yang → 10 “heavenly” energies.

12 Earthly Branches: Zodiac animals, cycle of time (12-year orbit of Jupiter, 12 months).

Interaction: Heaven + Earth cycles → energy patterns affecting events.

Lunar Stations: Moon moves through 28 “stations” tied to zodiac signs, for detailed timing.

Use: Timing of marriage, careers, politics, and personal forecasts. Less focused on personality/psychology than Western astrology.

Key Distinctions
Branch	Purpose	Tools	Focus
Medical Astrology	Health & healing	Decumbiture chart, planetary correspondences, herbs	Body & illness
Magical Astrology	Influence events	Talismans, spirits, planetary timing	Manifestation & magic
Horary Astrology	Answer questions	Chart of the moment	Decision-making, problem-solving
Western Astrology	Life patterns & events	Natal charts, planetary cycles	Personality, relationships, predictions
Chinese Astrology	Timing & cycles	Celestial stems, Earthly branches, lunar stations	Forecasting, event planning

General
Tibetan astrology is a synthesis of various systems of Indian Astrology and Chinese Astrology which are complemented by specific Tibetan elements concerning the concept of time and the role of astrology.

Like Indian astrology, Tibetan astrology works with the sidereal zodiac. The chart drawing is a square, and the houses are equal in size (House System) and run in a clockwise direction around the chart. Interpretations are based on the seven classical planets and the Moon's Nodes; the newly discovered spiritual planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto continue to play a minor role in Tibetan astrology and often are not even included in chart drawings.

Tibetan astrology, like Indian astrology, considers the Moon to be of central importance. The Indian legend of the Moon and the 27 houses or women it visits on its path through the zodiac is slightly different in Tibetan astrology. Here the Moon visits 28 goddesses in their palaces on its travels, although in order to harmonise the legend with the astronomical events, two of the palaces were united to make 27 Moon houses. However, 28 remains an important number for Tibetans. It stands for the four kings of the four points of the compass and the seven days or planets. Each of the four kings has four daughters whose palaces lie at the foot of the world mountain Meru. Meru, the mythical mountain at the centre of the universe, is often equated with the zodiac. Each of the 27 palaces has a different character and is used to interpret an individual's character and future.

The Tibetan method for the calculation of time is adopted from Chinese tradition. The idea that ten heavenly stems - the energies of the elements or planets - and twelve earthly branches - the cycle of time - determine our existence caused the Tibetans to adopt the system of matching years, months, days and double-hours to certain signs and elements alongside the individual horoscope. It has become tradition that each year is ruled by a particular sign of the zodiac which can have either favourable or unfavourable qualities. The Tibetans have adopted the Chinese classification for this system.

The Tibetans have developed several methods of calculating time independently from the Chinese model (Calendar). They have a cyclical concept of time. The linear addition of years only became established under the influence of foreign powers. Originally, the year consisted of twelve months of thirty days. In order to make up for the 5 1/4 missing days a leap month of 16 days was added every three years. The year was based on the Chinese model of twelve signs and five elements in masculine and feminine form so that one complete cycle lasted two times sixty years.

The beginning of the first cycle was thought to be the year 1027 which was the year in which the Kalachakra-Tantra or so-called wheel of time was translated from Sanskrit into the Tibetan language.

The general astrological practice which is based on Indian astrology, is to divide a life into nine unequal epochs which are ruled by the seven classical planets and the ascending and descending Moon's nodes which are different for each individual. This division leads to very concrete predictions regarding career and financial success, health matters and the character of an individual's life.

Astrology plays an important role in Tibetan medicine, a fact which is indicated by the name Men-Tsee-Khang (Tibetan medical and astrological institute) - located in Dharamsala, the former capital of north India - which continues to practice according to traditional Tibetan medical knowledge. Tibetan medicine believes that the human body is a reflection of the macrocosm. The human body is composed of the three basic elements Loong (roughly translated as wind), Tree-pa (roughly translated as bile) and Pay-gen (roughly translated as phlegm). Loong symbolises air and oxygen; Tree-pa fire and bodily heat; Pay-gen water and the lymphatic system. An individual is healthy when they are in harmony with each other. Illness is a signal that they are in a state of disharmony which the medical practitioner aims to rectify. The causes of this disharmony are the three archetypal evils greed, hate and ignorance. Too much greed leads to an excess of wind, too much hate to an excess of bile and ignorance to an excess of phlegm. Astrology can help to show where an individual's weaknesses lie and how the individual might be able to overcome them. In this sense, Tibetan astrology goes beyond making mere predictions and more so than other branches of Asian astrology has the aim of recognising an individual's psychic patterns and processes and helping in the healing process.

The Dragon in the Chinese Horoscope
Fifth sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a mythological creature (Yang).

The Dragon most closely corresponds to the Archetype of the Western Sagittarius, perhaps the Leo; in any case, it is a fire sign.[1]

The Dragon is viewed positively throughout Asia.[2] Norbert Giesow: It is considered the sign of luck and heavenly assistance. It is self-determined, seeks the public eye, and can be successful in almost any area. It does not like to listen to others but relies more on itself and its own judgment. People with the Dragon horoscope have many interests. They are athletic, generally healthy and vital, and very self-confident. The Dragon loves to travel.[3]

The attributes ascribed to it are courage, sincerity, optimism, generosity, authority, charisma, extroversion, and strength.
In the negative: Extravagance, lust for power, despotism, megalomania, arrogance, impatience, intolerance, and pride.[4]

Years of the Dragon: 1928 (Earth), 1940 (Metal), 1952 (Water), 1964 (Wood), 1976 (Fire), 1988 (Earth), 2000 (Metal), 2012 (Water), 2024 (Wood), and 2036 (Fire).[5]

The Rabbit in the Chinese Horoscope
Fourth sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese Astrology; a domestic animal (Yin).

The Rabbit shows great similarities with the Western Libra.[1]

The fact that it is known as cat in some Far Eastern countries also points to Venus and the zodiac sign Libra; not least the characteristics attributed to it:

Gentle and harmony-seeking, adaptability, charm, vanity, romance, sensitivity (also insecurity and anxiety), sensuality, nobility, attentiveness, hospitality, and peacefulness, aesthetics/artistic sense, and intelligence.

Norbert Giesow writes about it: The Rabbit is clever, avoids conflicts, and cannot handle disputes well. Instead, it often has a balancing effect. It is prudent and plans its endeavors with great care. It can invest a lot of time in beautifying its home. It is sociable, attentive, and sometimes chooses the easier path; relationships and contacts with other people are very important to it.[2]

Years of the Rabbit: 1927 (Fire), 1939 (Earth), 1951 (Metal), 1963 (Water), 1975 (Wood), 1987 (Fire), 1999 (Earth), 2011 (Metal), 2023 (Water), and 2035 (Wood).[3] Rat (Mouse)

2020 - Year of the Metal Rat[1]

The Rat (Mouse) in the Chinese Horoscope
First sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a wild animal (Yang).

Accordingly, the Rat (Mouse) corresponds to the western zodiac sign Aries.[2]

"Aries-like," the Rat is considered initiative, but also frivolous and impulsive, with a lack of perseverance; on one hand, it is sociable, while on the other, it can be aggressive, biting, and combative.

However, its motto “All or nothing!” fits better with the second Mars sign Scorpio, as well as its unbreakable "punching bag" nature, along with its negative traits of jealousy, desire for control, and vengefulness, as well as its authority, passion, and sharp insight.

Health-wise, the Rat also tends to exaggeration. Its vices are - rather typically Taurus[3] - gluttony and sweet idleness.[4]

Years of the Rat: 1924 (Wood), 1936 (Fire), 1948 (Earth), 1960 (Metal), 1972 (Water), 1984 (Wood), 1996 (Fire), 2008 (Earth), 2020 (Metal), and 2032 (Water).[5] Rooster (chinese)

The Proud Rooster

The Rooster (the Hen) in the Chinese Horoscope
Tenth sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a domestic animal (Yin).

The Rooster or the Hen exhibits several characteristics of the Archetype or western Zodiac Sign Leo, but also of the Virgo.[1]

He enjoys being the center of attention and presents himself, wanting to gain respect and recognition from others.

Positive traits include: Openness, sincerity, bravery, pride, boldness, and elegance. He is remarkably honest, direct, and fair, as well as original, enthusiastic in work matters or everyday affairs, pleasant, diligent, eager, and reliable.

Negative traits of the Roosters are: often being boastful, grandiose, arrogant, and showy, sometimes being brash and acting overly important. There is always a dependence on admiration from others, which should be considered by an observer when the sometimes glaring egoism surfaces, underlying all vanity and pedantry, intolerance, and tactlessness.

Years of the Rooster: 1921 (Metal), 1933 (Water), 1945 (Wood), 1957 (Fire), 1969 (Earth), 1981 (Metal), 1993 (Water), 2005 (Wood), 2017 (Fire), and 2029 (Earth).[2] Serpent (chinese)

The Dog as a Paper Cut

The Dog in the Chinese Horoscope
Eleventh sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a male animal (Yang).

The Dog shows several similarities to the Archetype or the western Zodiac Sign Capricorn.[1]

Positive traits include: He is idealistic, straightforward, honest, sincere, and unadulterated. Like our household dog, he is extremely loyal and affectionate. A family person. He proves to be very reliable, diligent, hardworking, and ambitious. He serves (not selfishly) always the cause, consistently stands up for what he recognizes as right, is defensive and steadfast.

Negative traits of Dogs are: Occasionally being stubborn and obstinate, rebellious and unruly. They tend to be hesitant, distrustful, and skeptical, generally having a rather pessimistic outlook. The Dog often appears emotionally cold, but is essentially oversensitive (which he must hide). He usually reacts slower than others and is often tense and stressed.

Years of the Dog: 1922 (Water), 1934 (Wood), 1946 (Fire), 1958 (Earth), 1970 (Metal), 1982 (Water), 1994 (Wood), 2006 (Fire), 2018 (Earth), and 2030 (Metal).[2] Goat

The Goat

The Goat (the Sheep) in Chinese Horoscope
Synonym: Goat

Eighth sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a feminine animal (Yin).

The Goat or Sheep is a kind of mixture of the Archetypes or western Earth signs Taurus and Virgo, with a "touch" of Libra.[1]

A Goat is characterized by reliability, a strong sense of responsibility, a connection to nature, and loyalty, as well as patience and stability. It is generally diligent, hardworking, thorough, and tidy.

Therefore, subordinate (but nonetheless very useful) activities are often undertaken, typically "small rolls" are baked.

Social qualities are pronounced, such as compassion, consideration, and helpfulness, appearing cautious, modest, and reserved.

However, adaptability or good-naturedness does not extend to being arbitrary; one is actually quite inflexible, relatively passive (inactive), simply slow to react, and tends to a certain stubbornness and reticence (often with hidden complaining).

Behind all of this lies a great gentleness and sensitivity, fundamentally very sensual, cozy, and cuddly (i.e., in need of love).

Years of the Goat: 1931 (Metal), 1943 (Water), 1955 (Wood), 1967 (Fire), 1979 (Earth), 1991 (Metal), 2003 (Water), 2015 (Wood), 2027 (Fire), and 2039 (Earth).[2Horse
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Horse in the Chinese Horoscope
Seventh sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese Astrology; a male animal (Yang).

The Horse shows great similarities to the Archetype Aquarius of the Western zodiac.[1]

Its positive traits include a certain charm (charisma) and openness, a keen intelligence, creativity and originality, a great love of freedom, an untamable drive for action, and a love for adventure (having fun and joy in new experiences).[2]

A Horse is friendly and humorous, flexible, independent, and intuitive. It particularly has the ability for "multitasking" (doing several things simultaneously or in parallel).

Friends and colleagues (like-minded individuals, the "peer group") are very important to it.

Negative traits include a certain stubbornness or "selfishness," as well as a rebelliousness or "obstinacy" that can only be understood through its great sensitivity.

Underlying this is a nearly unmanageable nervousness and restlessness (always "on the run," "always ready"), easily irritated, disturbed, and distracted. Hence the chronic impatience, instability, and inconsistency.

The Monkey in the Chinese horoscope
Ninth sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a wild animal (Yang).

When the zodiac begins with the Rat, the Monkey corresponds to the Western zodiac sign Sagittarius; however, according to other authors, it corresponds to the sign Gemini. The characteristics attributed to it fit best:

The Monkey is intelligent, clever, mentally active, knows a solution for every problem. It thinks and talks a lot, and enjoys reading. It loves discussions and exchanging ideas, is fun-loving, humorous, tricky, and impatient. Sometimes it lacks the necessary seriousness.[1]

It is sometimes even associated with the Western Leo.[2]

It shows many parallels to the Archetype of the zodiac sign Taurus, and to the planet Venus. Essentially, the Pig in China does not carry the negative connotations it has in the West, but rather the positive ones of a lucky pig.[1]

Positive traits of the Pig are: It is honest, understanding, and peaceful, good-natured, sincere, and helpful. It is usually well-organized, a good worker: persistent, loyal, reliable, stable, and steadfast. Additionally, it is sociable.[2]

Negative traits include: Sometimes being shy and melancholic, gullible and naive, as well as stubborn, materialistic, spoiled - and occasionally a bit lazy.

Eight Division by Jakob Böhme[1]
The "Octoilogram" (abbreviated OG) is a mundane astrological method discovered by Klaus Wessel in 2011.

Theory
The term[2] refers to the octagonal structure that arises when I complement the cardinal Cross with that of the fixed signs. The degrees "15 fixed" are more than just the mere half-distance points between the first degrees of the cardinal signs. Rather, they represent the culmination points (= peaks) in the developmental process from Aries to Cancer, from Cancer to Libra, from Libra to Capricorn, and from Capricorn back to Aries. To stay in the image of movement: with the attainment of 15 degrees fixed, a transformation in the energetic process occurs: the closer the movement approaches the culmination point, the more kinetic energy is converted into potential or statically concentrated energy. At the culmination point itself, the maximum amount of potential energy is reached.


The four OGs in the annual cycle
Technique
It is a horoscope that is created exactly at the solar position of 15°00 of the fixed signs Aquarius, Taurus, Leo, or Scorpio. The octograms are associated with a similar predictive capability as is traditionally known from the cardinal horoscopes, which are created with a solar position at 0° Aries (Spring Equinox), 0° Cancer (Summer Solstice), 0° Libra (Autumn Equinox), and 0° Capricorn (Winter Solstice). The octogram always applies for an entire year and characterizes the themes of the respective seasonal quadrants from their center; for example, of spring - Aries, Taurus, Gemini. The corresponding octogram is the horoscope with a solar position of 15°00 Taurus, with the beginning of the year set at 15° Aquarius. Thus, the Aquarius-OG is attributed a higher significance. It has an initiating function, comparable to the first of the cardinal signs, Aries.
From these octograms, derivations can be made using Progressions and Directions, just as one can fundamentally apply these to any horoscope. A special role is currently attributed to the Lunar created on an OG, allowing for further differentiations. Furthermore, the pre-birth establishment of an octogram is recommended, which allows for a long-term typification of subsequent births or events.


Octagram
Validity
An octogram always applies to an entire group (a collective/a cohort of individuals) or to all events of a quarter or year - at a location. This means that contrary to the usual maxim of astrology, the location here is more significant than the presence of an exact birth time.

The OG characterizes the typical or special characteristics and features for an entire period (an epoch).

History
Annual Festivals
In the Christian calendar, the middle of the fixed signs (at the solar position there) includes the festivals of Candlemas (February 2, when it is coldest in winter), the "Witches' Festival" Walpurgis (April 30 or May 1), the Assumption of Mary (August 15, during the peak of summer heat), as well as All Saints' Day or All Souls' Day (Samhain-Halloween, November 1).


The Four Evangelists at the Cathedral of Chartres[3]
Fixed Cross
The fixed signs also have the peculiarity that they were assigned the four Evangelists in the Middle Ages (see illustration). There were different approaches in this regard, but the assignment by Jerome prevailed:

Matthew: Aquarius A49_249.gif
Mark: Leo A32_137.gif
Luke: Taurus A46_218.gif
John: Eagle (Scorpio) A44_205.gif
This may have its origin in the Babylonian tradition, which saw the fixed signs as guardians of the World Signs. The four signs first appear in the Bible with the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel. The assignments can be found in sacred art from late antiquity to the Renaissance.

The "15 degrees fixed" received significant attention from prominent astrologers, such as Dane Rudhyar or Wolfgang Döbereiner, who included these degrees in his list of Group Fate Points. Even Alfred Witte, founder of the Hamburg School, likely had these degrees in mind and recognized their significance.
Wessel: “... the old astrologers drew their wisdom and knowledge of future collective fates [among others] from the positions at 15° Taurus, 15° Aquarius, 15° Scorpio, 15° Leo, because here lies the mean between the meridian and the horizon of the Earth, when the North Pole is considered as the zenith or as the birth point of the northern hemisphere.”

Even in Classical Astrology, the eight division has a certain tradition - see the ancient Octotopos.[4] Not least, the Semi-Square or Octile plays a significant role in modern Cosmobiology, as well as in the Hamburg School, also in individual astrology.

Chinese Epoch Division
The Chinese New Year is always celebrated from late January to mid-February. Wessel assumes that the Aquarius octograms correspond with fundamental rhythms, so that the traditional Chinese sequence of time quality (based on 60-year intervals) can also lead to significant statements in Western Tropical Astrology. The Chinese calendar begins with the Chinese New Year of the year 2636 BC. The sixty rhythms that begin in that year are traditionally summarized in a hierarchical manner into overarching time units: three sixty cycles to 180 years, six to 360 years, and 60 times 60 cycles to the maximum cycle of 3600 years. The second maximum cycle thus began with the Aquarius-OG of the year 964 AD. 720 years later, with the Aquarius-OG of 1684, the third 360-phase began within this maximum cycle. Its effectiveness, according to Wessel, significantly determines mundane events until the year 2044. This period experiences its differentiations through the individual sub-cycles, each covering sixty years. The cycle that began in 1984 is thus the sixth and final phase of the epoch that started in 1684.

The interactions of the overarching and subordinate time images form complex relationship patterns, comparable to the interactions of the Great Conjunctions (of Jupiter and Saturn).


The I Ching has eight trigrams
I Ching and Astrology
Wessel relates the eight trigrams of the I Ching (Book of Changes) to the Western zodiac as follows:

15 Aquarius - 30 Pisces: Trigram Zhen (= in the Chinese Nine Stars the number 3)
0 Aries - 15 Taurus: Sun (= 4)
15 Taurus - 30 Gemini: Li (= 9)
0 Cancer - 15 Leo: Kun (= 2)
15 Leo - 30 Virgo: Dui (= 7)
0 Libra - 15 Scorpio: Qian (= 6)
15 Scorpio - 30 Sagittarius: Kan (= 1)
0 Capricorn - 15 Aquarius: Gen (= 8)[5]
Evaluation
The octogram is a method that brings remarkable insights, especially in the mundane area - i.e., in overarching, collective events. It represents an enrichment of the astrological toolkit, opening an expanded view of the zodiac. The octograms apparently represent - as so-called epoch horoscopes - mundane caesuras (changes, cuts).

Wessel's reference to Chinese and Japanese astrology or the so-called "Nine Stars" need not be shared or followed. After all, these Far Eastern methods were developed under entirely different cultural and historical conditions than those familiar to us in the Western context. Number Mysticism
(Redirected from Numerology)
Jump to navigationJump to search

Dividing the circle by 6 results in the aspects of sextiles and trines
Number mysticism is one of the most important symbolic aspects of astrology and at the same time some of the roots of number mysticism are to be found in celestial observation. Number symbolism holds the view that numbers have not only a quantitative-numerical value where one number follows the next, but also possess an inherent quality independent of their numerical value. This quality enables us to comprehend cosmic cycles and laws and to transfer and relate them to life on Earth. Some esoteric schools (like the Kabbalah) associate letters of the alphabet with certain numbers and so come to a completely different understanding of texts such as the Bible.

Western number mysticism can largely be traced back to the ideas of the Greek mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras. According to him, number is the archetype of all things. Among German astrologers Thomas Ring in particular has studied number mysticism.

The basic astrological numbers are three and four. Three is considered to be a divine number. It resolves the polarity represented by the number two. Four is considered to be a material number and the square with its four corners is thought to be the archetypal symbol of the mundane sphere. When three and four are added the result is seven, the number of classical planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn). Four times seven is 28, the number of days the Moon takes to orbit the Earth once, and roughly the number of years that Saturn takes to orbit the Sun. It takes Uranus seven years to pass through one sign of the zodiac and twelve times seven (84) years to pass through all the signs. Three times four is twelve, the number of signs of the zodiac and the total number of houses in a horoscope, but also the number of years Jupiter takes to make one orbit of the sun.

ChatGPT said:
Ah, you’ve pulled a deep dive into Tibetan and Chinese astrology, plus some Western and numerological overlays—it’s a fascinating mash-up of systems that all share some underlying patterns but interpret them differently. Let me unpack the main points and make it coherent:

Tibetan Astrology (Spaho / srid pa ho)
Foundations:

A hybrid system, synthesizing Indian astrology (Jyotisha) and Chinese astrology, with uniquely Tibetan elements.

Works on the sidereal zodiac (like Indian astrology), with square charts divided into equal houses running clockwise.

The Moon is central—its 28 palaces (sometimes merged into 27 for alignment) influence personality, character, and fortune.

Time & Cycles:

Adopts the Chinese 10 heavenly stems and 12 earthly branches, creating a 60-year cycle.

Original Tibetan years had 12 months of 30 days; leap months added for calendar alignment.

Each year is assigned an animal sign and an element, which can be “favorable” or “unfavorable.”

Medical Integration:

Astrology is deeply tied to Tibetan medicine (Men-Tsee-Khang).

Human health is seen as a microcosm of the universe; Loong (wind), Tree-pa (bile), Pay-gen (phlegm) correspond to imbalances caused by greed, hate, ignorance.

Astrology is used diagnostically, showing vulnerabilities and pathways for healing.

Life Epochs:

Lives are divided into nine unequal epochs, ruled by planets and lunar nodes, helping predict career, health, and personal traits.

Chinese Zodiac Overview (and Tibetan adoption)
12 Animals:

Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.

Each has Yin/Yang qualities, associated elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), and cyclical years.

General Traits:

Example: Dragon – fire, luck, charisma, extroversion, but prone to arrogance.

Rabbit – Venusian, Libra-like, gentle, sensitive, diplomatic.

Rat – Aries/Scorpio-like, initiative-driven but sometimes manipulative.

Each animal has positive and negative tendencies, which inform predictions for the year and individual character.

Advanced & Modern Concepts
Octilogram / Eight Division (Jakob Böhme / Klaus Wessel):

Uses 15° of the fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) for mundane predictions.

Focuses on collective or epochal trends, not personal birth charts.

Connects to the I Ching trigrams, Western zodiac, and even annual festivals.

Useful for long-term social or political forecasting, less so for individual astrology.

Number Mysticism:

Numbers carry symbolic meaning beyond counting; e.g.,

3 = divine, resolves polarity.

4 = material, square, stability.

3 × 4 = 12 (signs, houses, Jupiter orbit), 4 × 7 = 28 (lunar cycle), 7 planets.

Links cosmic cycles to human experience, tying Tibetan, Chinese, and Western numerological systems together.

Key Takeaways
Tibetan astrology = Moon-focused, holistic, healing-oriented; Indian + Chinese influence.

Chinese zodiac = archetypes, yearly cycles, elemental qualities, Yin/Yang polarity.

Octilogram / epochs = macrocosmic predictions, collective trends, not personal charts.

Numbers in astrology = cosmic patterns expressed mathematically, linking planets, cycles, and time.

If you want, I can make a visual “crosswalk” table that shows Tibetan year signs, Chinese zodiac, elements, and Western zodiac equivalents, including traits—so you can see the full system in one glance.

Do you want me to do that?

Analogy
Jump to navigationJump to search

Representation of the concept "as above, so below"[1]
Reasoning by analogy (from Greek ἀναλογία, analogia, "proportion") means inferring information about unknown phenomena from phenomena which are known and easily observed; or deducing similarities or coordination among seemingly dissimilar things.

Analogy is one of two fundamental explanatory models in astrology. According to this principle, celestial bodies correlate with events on earth rather than causing them. Astra inclinant, non necessitant - The stars incline, they do not determine. This was the main postulate of Christian astrology in the Middle Ages, also saying "As above So below", or "Earth and cosmos reflect each other".
Analogy is also at work in the assignment of the various rulerships in astrology. For example, as mythological Mars was the Roman god of war (to the ancients, a "known" phenomenon), the planet Mars, by extention, rules soldiers and conflict.

Astrology's major alternative explanatory model of causality postulates direct cause and effect between planetary positions as independent variables and human events and behavior as dependent variables.

Reasoning by analogy in astrology effectively presupposes that the cosmos being a holistic system. Human beings are a small unit or microcosm of the cosmos or macrocosm because each individual contains a model or manifestation of the universal whole. The sun, therefore, is not simply the central star of our solar system, but is equally the creative principle of humanity. Psychological astrologers essentially use the microcosm/macrocosm model when they interpret the planets in an individual horoscope in terms of widely shared, cross-cultural psychological processes.

In esoteric astrology the human body partakes of the earth element but the human soul is a portion of the greater universal divine consciousness. The use of a man-cosmos analogy in esoteric astrology dates back to the philosopher Plato, whose work was reinterpreted in the Hermetic movement of Hellenistic Egypt named for Hermes Trismegistos, a legendary or mythical founder of a fusion of Egyptian and Platonic spiritual ideals.

General
Although popularly known as the source of modern playing cards, and also having a reputation for its use among gypsies as a means of fortune telling, the tarot images known as the Rider-Waite deck are revered by occultists as being a picture book of wisdom relaying the spiritual and psychological principles of consciousness. These images were reportedly designed by a group of spiritual initiates circa 1200 AD in the city of Fez, Morocco, based on spiritual teachings gleaned from Egypt, the Biblical Old and New Testaments, India, Europe and China, in order to keep the truths of spiritual thought intact for future world cultures, in a form which could be understood by anyone in the world regardless of their native language.

Pictures were also chosen because it was realized that the human mind responds to images much more easily than written text, an idea which would later, in the twentieth century, be used by advertisers, and formulated into the saying "A picture tells a thousand words". To prevent deliberate attack or suppression of the teaching of these principles, they were disguised as a game. Each card in tarot is known as a "key" rather than a card, to convey the idea that the image is a key to the door to esoteric or spiritual knowledge about consciousness. The name "tarot" is derived from the Latin word "rota" meaning circle or wheel, which appears to spell tarot when the letters are placed in a circle, as on the image of key number 10, The Wheel Of Fortune (Jupiter in astrology).

The 78 images or keys of tarot are divided into Major and Minor Arcana, the word arcana meaning secret or esoteric. The Major Arcana consist of 22 keys which correspond to the principles assigned to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, so that The Fool key, for example, has the first letter of this alphabet Aleph associated with it, and the Magician is assigned to the second letter, Beth, ending with the World key, assigned to the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Tav. The 56 keys of the Minor Arcana are similar to our 52 playing cards, with the addition of four extra court cards known as Pages, and are comprised of four suits, Wands, Cups, Swords and Pentacles, which correspond to the four elements of astrology, Fire, Water, Air and Earth respectively. In the relatively modern branch of occultism known as Qabalah, which was derived in the late 19th century from Jewish mysticism or Kabbalah, these Minor tarot arcana correspond to the four levels of creation, which are the Archetypal (Fire), imaginative (Water), active (Air) and manifested/physical (Earth), while the Major Arcana keys are assigned to the paths connecting the Sephiroth on the qabalistic Tree Of Life. The French occultist and former Catholic priest Eliphas Levi is often credited as connecting the Major tarot keys to the kabbalistic Tree Of Life[1].

In kabbalistic philosophy, creation is said to occur with a lightening bolt which travels through the Tree Of Life. The ten spheres or sephiroth on the tree correspond to astrology's inner and outer planets; Neptune is associated with the top sphere or emanation of Deity, the ineffable Oneness of creation, Uranus is associated with sphere 2, known as Chokmah or Wisdom and associated with light, the first recognizable manifestation of Deity. This sphere is also known as the Sphere Of The Zodiac to indicate light and energy emanating from stars. Sphere number three is Binah, assigned to Saturn, and this represents the contraction or limitation of light energy into matter. These first three sephiroth are sometimes known as the Supernal Triad. There is also an invisible sephira in between this Supernal Triad and the Higher Mind levels of consciousness described below representing what is known as The Abyss or Daath. Astrologically, this is sometimes associated with Pluto. Some students of kabbalah who also study physics see an analogy between the Supernal Triad and Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, or Mass-Energy equivalence, E=mc2[2].

Sphere number four known as Chesed or Mercy, corresponds to Jupiter, sphere five, Geburah, or Justice to Mars, and the central integrating sphere number six, Tipharth or Beauty to the Sun. Spheres number seven and eight correspond to the personality level of consciousness, to Venus and Mercury respectively, or Netzach and Hod, while sphere number nine, Yesod represents the subconscious mind which humans share with all creation, sometimes known as the animal soul, represented astrologically by the Moon, and known as "Foundation". All the above emanations are grounded in the Earth level of creation known as Malkuth.

The Major Arcana
The 22 Major Arcana tarot keys display many esoteric principles of astrology, since they are comprised of the twelve concepts which astrologers assign to the modern Zodiac, and the ten "planets" (which are not really planets but astronomical bodies representing spiritual or psychological principles) used in Western horoscopes i.e. Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto). Although the last three of these, known as the Outer Planets in astrology, were only discovered in the past three hundred years, the designers of tarot, and their predecessors who intuitively received the idea of the Tree Of Life, understood their esoteric principles and left spaces for them on these maps of consciousness, believing that their outer symbols would be discovered in future centuries by astronomers in the form of planets in our Solar system.

Spiritual Astrology is a general term for several types of natal astrology that use the horoscope as a means to develop the individual’s awareness of the soul or enlightenment, as opposed to a focus on the physical or material aspects of life. Spirituality is often interpreted as religion, but astrologers distinguish their approach from the formalized religious denominations‘ hierarchies and doctrines. Some spiritual astrologers, however, operate within a religious worldview such as the Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus. Spirituality may overlap with mysticism, as a direct apprehension of the numinous or divine. Spiritual astrologers often combine astrology with other practices and belief systems, such as theosophy, numerology, tarot, or Kabbalah.

Although their boundaries overlap considerably, the main divisions of spiritual astrology are:

Esoteric astrology focuses on practices developed in the past by secret societes or experts for a small group of initiates, such as alchemy, Rosecrucianism, and shamanism. The New Age movement popularized some of these systems for a wider audience.
Karmic astrology may be Hindu or western in orientation, but it construes the horoscope as manifesting the soul’s past, present, and even future lives, due to a belief in reincarnation.
Humanistic astrology was popularized by Dane Rudhyar, Alexander Ruperti, Alan Oken, and Jeff Green as a hybrid of psychological astrology and the Theosophical movement, as well as new insights from the fields of psychology, philosophy, and comparative religion. Microcosm/Macrocosm
Jump to navigationJump to search

As above, so below[1]
A term which is particularly significant within esoteric astrology as an explanatory model for the concept of analogy. According to this idea, the wider macrocosmic universe is reflected in the smaller microcosmic world, including human beings. Everything that happens in one dimension has its correspondence in the other. Astrology is therefore seen as a tool to decipher the cosmic plan in the human sphere.

The concept of a relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm is very similar to the idea behind astrology itself, but it also appears in other spiritual teachings and is not restricted to astronomical observations. The first person to fully develop this idea was the Greek philosopher Plato (ca. 427-347 BCE) although esoteric astrologers generally associate it with the legendary figure of Hermes Trismegistos.

The Goat

The Goat (the Sheep) in Chinese Horoscope
Synonym: Goat

Eighth sign of the Chinese solar zodiac or Chinese astrology; a feminine animal (Yin).

The Goat or Sheep is a kind of mixture of the Archetypes or western Earth signs Taurus and Virgo, with a "touch" of Libra.[1]

A Goat is characterized by reliability, a strong sense of responsibility, a connection to nature, and loyalty, as well as patience and stability. It is generally diligent, hardworking, thorough, and tidy.

Therefore, subordinate (but nonetheless very useful) activities are often undertaken, typically "small rolls" are baked.

Social qualities are pronounced, such as compassion, consideration, and helpfulness, appearing cautious, modest, and reserved.

However, adaptability or good-naturedness does not extend to being arbitrary; one is actually quite inflexible, relatively passive (inactive), simply slow to react, and tends to a certain stubbornness and reticence (often with hidden complaining).

Behind all of this lies a great gentleness and sensitivity, fundamentally very sensual, cozy, and cuddly (i.e., in need of love).

Years of the Goat: 1931 (Metal), 1943 (Water), 1955 (Wood), 1967 (Fire), 1979 (Earth), 1991 (Metal), 2003 (Water), 2015 (Wood), 2027 (Fire), and 2039 (Earth).[2] Air Sign

The four elements/temperaments and their features[1]
In addition to being divided into qualities, the zodiac is also divided into four substances or "elements": fire, earth, air and water.

History
According to Greek philosophers of the 5th century BCE, the four elements form the basis of all being, although Aristotle (4th century BCE) added a 5th element, "ether", the substance from which the heavens were made. The four terrestrial elements originate from the archetypal qualities of dry, wet, hot, and cold. Fire is dry and hot, air is wet and hot, water is wet and cold, whereas the earth element is dry and cold.

Temperament
The four temperaments are also reflected in the elements. The choleric equates to fire, sanguine to air, phlegmatic to water, and melancholic to earth. Greek astrologers assigned the twelve signs of the zodiac to the four elements, too. This classification still remains valid in western astrology.

Elements
Fire and air are classified as masculine elements, embodying the active and positive principle; with earth and water embodying the feminine, receptive "negative" pole. The terms "positive" and "negative" are not used in any kind of judgmental sense, however; but simply as contrasts between two polarities.

Fire
Fire is associated with the signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. Fire stands for dynamism, energy and power. Fire is the initiator of actions and a force for change. It transforms matter into energy, a process which can result in the radiation of pleasant warmth or destructive heat. On a spiritual level, fire symbolises the divine spark or spiritual purification. This idea finds expression in the image of the fires of purgatory as a place of transformation.


Mosaic Capricorn[2]
Earth
The element that comes after fire in the zodiac is earth. This principle is embodied in the signs of Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. Earth forms the material basis for all human life, including physical well-being. The challenge facing the earth signs is to find appropriate expression for material needs beyond mere avarice on the one side and disdain on the other.

Air
Air is represented by Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. Air stands for contact with others, intellectual capacity, as well as a way to higher spiritual understanding. Air stimulates clarity of thought and the ability to make decisions. Without clarity of thought no insight is possible, and this is one of the elements of meditative contemplation in many wisdom teachings considered to be a necessary prerequisite to gain access to spiritual dimensions.

Water
The water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Water stands for the emotions and intuition. In nature water is the origin of all life. It is the only element symbolised in astrology exclusively by animals, an allusion to the fact that in water intuition and instinct are more powerful than intellect. On a spiritual level, Water becomes the carrier of the all-encompassing divine love. The ancient myth of the holy grail is an expression of this.

The Elements in Eastern Astrology
Chinese astrology uses five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. Wood is the first element which, when burned to ashes through fire, becomes earth. The earth brings forth veins of metal out of which water flows, which in turn nourishes the earth which brings forth wood and other plant life. Each element equates with one of the five classical planets: Jupiter with wood, Mars with fire, Saturn with earth, Venus with metal and Mercury with water.

Hindu astrology also uses the elements of ancient Greece, but in somewhat different ways. [3] A fifth element, akasha, translated as Aristotle's "ether" or "space", is similar to air in western astrology, but specifically indicates the creative principle. People's temperaments and phyical health may be described as kapha (earthy and a bit watery), vata (airy, with some ether), or pitta (firey). Akasha relates to the planet Jupiter yet is ruled by Venus. The firey planets are the sun and Mars. Mercury is earthy (cf. its rulership of Virgo); whereas the "feminine" planets, the moon and Venus, are watery. Saturn is the air planet (the traditional ruler of Aquarius in western astrology). The Hindus' system of assigning different elements to people's health conditions is the basis of their Ayurvedic system of nutrition and medicine. Feminine

The feminine polarity in the zodiac (green and blue signs)
Synonyms:

Attributes:

negative
Together with Masculine, one of the pairs of terms that express the fundamental Polarity in the Zodiac. The feminine energy represents the receptive and passive, the inward-directed, the force from which an action arises. It is the organizing principle that holds onto what is tried and true. If it is overemphasized, stagnation and lethargy are the result.

The feminine complements and conditions the masculine and vice versa - one cannot exist without the other. In the zodiac, the Earth signs Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, as well as the Water signs Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, are associated with the feminine principle (Element); among the classical planets, they are Moon and Venus. Saturn is assigned a masculine gender in classical astrology (e.g., in the Tetrabiblos[1]). Other astrologers, such as Johannes Vehlow (Vol. II, p. 184[2]), assign him - like the zodiac sign Capricorn - to the feminine gender.

The feminine principle is not only represented by women. It is one of the most important challenges for every personality to integrate both feminine and masculine aspects within themselves (see Anima/Animus). The horoscope provides information about where masculine and where feminine aspects are expressed.

Zodiac Signs and Houses
All Earth and Water Sign are feminine, thus the even-numbered signs, which are called night signs[3]. This should not be interpreted to mean that a "night sign" is automatically below the horizon, but rather means "feminine" in terms of polarity.

The night signs correspond to the Earth Signp and Water Signs:

Taurus
Cancer
Virgo
Scorpio
Capricorn
Pisces
Similarly, this can also be applied to the houses: the even-numbered houses can be interpreted as feminine, namely the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth house.

Planets
The night planets, also of feminine polarity, are considered[3]:

Moon
Venus
Mars, although it is assigned to the masculine planets.
(Mercury is indifferent, thus neither electric nor magnetic).

The Moon, as the planet that only reflects light and is constantly changing, is considered the feminine archetype. As the only one of the classical planets, it has only one feminine domicile, that of Cancer. Venus and Mars each have a masculine domicile with Libra and Aries, making the feminine force less pronounced than with the Moon.

When a feminine planet (night planet) is above the horizon (thus in the night half) and in a night sign during a night birth, this is referred to in classical astrology as Hayiz, which represents an accidental dignity. Gender

Magician and Dragon at the Great Cauldron.[1]
A form of Polarity in astrology.

In esoteric terminology, gender, meaning male or female, generally refers to the "giving," "radiating" nature (male) and the "receiving," "absorbing" nature (female). This does not imply any value judgment; it is always emphasized that both together create a unity, as depicted in the Yin/Yang symbol. Psychologically, every person contains both male and female aspects.

In a narrower sense, polarity in astrology refers to the classification of zodiac signs into male and female.

Elements, temperaments and humours
Modern astrology takes many of its insights on personality from the field of psychology. Traditional astrologers of the past, in contrast, considered the four elements of Antiquity and their qualities as these manifested in human health and behaviour. The four temperaments are:

Choleric (hot and dry) equates to the fire element and the signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.
Sanguine (hot and moist) refers to the air element and the signs Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.
Phlegmatic (cold and moist) connotes the water element as well as Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.
Melancholic (cold and dry) indicates the earth element, and Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.
The four temperaments in traditional medical astrology also refer to the four humours of Antiquity, or bodily fluids believed to govern health and disposition. The most commonly described fluids were:


The Temperaments by Lavater (1775)[2]

The four Temperaments as modern Smileys
Empedocles's model
The following table shows the four humors with their corresponding elements, seasons, sites of formation, and resulting temperaments:

Humor	Season	Age	Element	Organ	Temperaments
Blood	Spring	Infancy	Air	Liver	Warm and moist	Sanguine
Yellow bile	Summer	Youth	Fire	Gallbladder	Warm and dry	Choleric
Black bile	Autumn	Adulthood	Earth	Spleen	Cold and dry	Melancholic
Phlegm	Winter	Old age	Water	Brain/Lungs	Cold and moist	Phlegmatic
Fire: "yellow bile" could promote anger or peevishness.
Air: blood symbolized courage and optimism.
Water: phlegm made the disposition calm and placid.
Earth: '"black bile made people sad ("melancholic") or irritable.

The four humors and their qualities
Western medicine
The humoralist system of medicine was highly individualistic, for all patients were said to have their own unique humoral composition. From Hippocrates onward, the humoral theory was adopted by Greek, Roman and Islamic Medicine, and dominated the view of the human body among European physicians until at least 1543 when it was first seriously challenged by Andreas Vesalius, who mostly criticized Galen's theories of human anatomy and not the chemical hypothesis of behavioural regulation (temperament).

Typical 18th-century practices such as bloodletting a sick person or applying hot cups to a person were based on the humoral theory of imbalances of fluids (blood and bile in those cases). Methods of treatment like bloodletting, emetics and purges were aimed at expelling a surplus of a humor. Apocroustics were medications intended to stop the flux of malignant humors to a diseased body part.


The Colericus in the Tuebinger Hausbuch (1550)

The Phlegnaticus in the Tuebinger Hausbuch
16th-century Swiss physician Paracelsus further developed the idea that beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals and various alchemical combinations thereof. These beliefs were the foundation of mainstream Western medicine well into the 17th century. Specific minerals or herbs were used to treat ailments simple to complex, from an uncomplicated upper respiratory infection to the plague. For example, chamomile was used to decrease heat, and lower excessive bile humor. Arsenic was used in a poultice bag to 'draw out' the excess humor(s) that led to symptoms of the plague. Apophlegmatisms, in pre-modern medicine, were medications chewed in order to draw away phlegm and humors.

Although advances in cellular pathology and chemistry criticized humoralism by the 17th century, the theory had dominated Western medical thinking for more than 2,000 years. Only in some instances did the theory of humoralism wane into obscurity. One such instance occurred in the sixth and seventh centuries in the Byzantine Empire when traditional secular Greek culture gave way to Christian influences. Though the use of humoralist medicine continued during this time, its influence was diminished in favor of religion. The revival of Greek humoralism, owing in part to changing social and economic factors, did not begin until the early ninth century.

If the patient's four humours got out of balance, doctors believed that illness or personality disorders could result. Temperament had further associations, such as with the seasons and Planets. The Sun, for example, is hot and dry while the Moon is cold and moist. Belief in astrological influences over the humours, health, and personality was one reason why the predominant Christian authorities permitted medieval and renaissance medical students to study astrology.

The four personality types still retain some currency in the English language. For example, sang as the French root for "blood" appears in the English word "sanguine", meaning optimistic. The medical system of India retains a similar system of astrological correspondences. Traditional astrologers today look at temperament as an alternative to psychology in analysing people's dispositions.  Masculine

"Masculine" and Feminine is one of the pairs of terms that describe the fundamental polarity in the zodiac. The masculine energy represents the dynamic, forward-moving principle that creates new things, the outward-directed, the action in which a force is expressed.
The masculine complements and conditions the feminine and vice versa - one cannot be conceived without the other.

Originally, the assignment of "masculine" and "feminine" comes from human gender, where men were seen as the active part in conception and women as the passive part, but this designation is now used in astrology independently of that, as every person possesses both active and passive traits. This mutual permeation of masculine and feminine qualities is vividly illustrated in Eastern Yin/Yang and Tai Chi.

The horoscope provides information about where masculine and where feminine aspects are expressed.

Zodiac Signs and Houses
All Fire and Air Signs are considered masculine, thus the odd-numbered signs, which are referred to as day signs[2]. This should not be interpreted to mean that a "day sign" is automatically above the horizon line, but rather simply means "masculine" in terms of polarity.

The day signs are:

Aries
Gemini
Leo
Libra
Sagittarius
Aquarius
Analogously, this can also be applied to the houses: the odd-numbered houses can be interpreted as masculine, namely the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh house.

Planets
The day planets, also of masculine polarity, are[2]:

Sun
Jupiter
Saturn
Mars is also considered masculine, even though it is associated with the night planets. (Mercury is neutral, thus neither electric nor magnetic).

The Sun, as the purely radiant star at the center of the solar system, is regarded as the masculine archetype. As the only classical planet, it has only one masculine domicile, that of Leo. Jupiter and Saturn each have a feminine domicile with the Pisces and Capricorn, making their masculine strength less pronounced than that of the Sun.

When a masculine planet (day planet) is in a day sign at a day birth, this is referred to in classical astrology as Hayiz, which represents an accidental dignity.

A form of Polarity that refers to opposite sections of the zodiac.

The twelve zodiac signs form six polar pairs, each consisting of two opposing and complementary signs (see also the Yin/Yang symbol). Within the concept of an Axis, these polarities can be grouped under a common theme, similar to the House Axes:

Aries/ Libra = I and You
Taurus/ Scorpio = Holding on and Overcoming
Gemini/ Sagittarius = Knowledge and Understanding
Cancer/ Capricorn = Privacy and Publicity
Leo/ Aquarius = Individuality and Group

ChatGPT said:
Wow—this is a dense compilation! Let’s untangle it a bit so it’s more digestible and you can see the connections across astrology, tarot, and esoteric philosophy. I’ll synthesize and highlight the key ideas.

1. Analogy & Microcosm/Macrocosm
Core concept: “As above, so below.”

Meaning: The universe (macrocosm) and the human being (microcosm) mirror each other. Observing celestial patterns can give insight into human behavior and vice versa.

Astrological application: Planets don’t directly cause events—they “incline” them. Mars symbolizes war because of mythological associations; the planets reflect human psychological archetypes rather than strictly dictating actions.

Esoteric angle: The human soul is a fragment of universal consciousness; astrology becomes a tool to read this reflection.

2. Tarot as a Symbolic Map
Tarot images = keys to consciousness:
The 78 cards (Major and Minor Arcana) encode universal principles, psychological processes, and cosmic patterns.

Major Arcana (22 keys): Correspond to Hebrew letters and astrological archetypes. For example:

The Fool (0) → Aleph → new beginnings

Wheel of Fortune (10) → Jupiter → cycles of fate

Outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) were incorporated intuitively before their astronomical discovery.

Minor Arcana (56 keys): Linked to four elements and four levels of creation:

Wands → Fire → Archetypal / Creative

Cups → Water → Imaginative / Emotional

Swords → Air → Active / Intellectual

Pentacles → Earth → Physical / Material

Qabalistic integration: Cards correspond to the Sephiroth and paths of the Tree of Life. Tarot is essentially a visual map of consciousness, mirroring spiritual and planetary energies.

3. Elements, Polarity, and Temperament
Four classical elements (Greek & Western astrology):

Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Active, passionate, initiator of change

Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Practical, grounded, stable

Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Intellectual, communicative

Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Emotional, intuitive

Feminine (Yin) vs Masculine (Yang):

Feminine: Receptive, passive, nurturing → Earth & Water signs

Masculine: Active, extroverted, initiating → Fire & Air signs

Key: Everyone contains both; astrology shows where each expresses in a chart.

Temperaments & humors (historical perspective):

Sanguine → Air → Optimistic, social

Choleric → Fire → Ambitious, aggressive

Phlegmatic → Water → Calm, reflective

Melancholic → Earth → Thoughtful, reserved

These linked personality and health to astrological influences historically.

4. Spiritual Astrology
Goal: Use astrology to awaken the soul, not just predict material events.

Branches:

Esoteric astrology: Secretive, mystical, often tied to alchemy, shamanism, or Rosecrucianism.

Karmic astrology: Examines past, present, and future lives; linked to reincarnation.

Humanistic astrology: Psychological integration with spiritual insights (Rudhyar, Oken, Green).

Macrocosm/microcosm application: Astrology as a map of spiritual growth and self-realization; the chart is a mirror of cosmic principles operating in the individual.

5. Synthesis
Everything here points to interconnected systems of analogy:

Planets ↔ human psyche ↔ archetypes

Tarot ↔ spiritual map ↔ astrological energies

Elements ↔ personality ↔ physiological & spiritual tendencies

Masculine/feminine polarities ↔ dynamic flow of energy in life

Microcosm/macrocosm ↔ universal principle of reflection

Bottom line: Astrology, tarot, and esoteric teachings are symbolic languages describing the same universal patterns in different forms. It’s a system of mirrors—look at one level (a card, planet, or element), and you can infer the qualities at another (person, psyche, soul).

If you want, I can make a visual “map of analogy” showing how planets, tarot cards, elements, and polarities all interconnect—like a condensed cheat sheet for this whole system.

Elements, temperaments and humours
Modern astrology takes many of its insights on personality from the field of psychology. Traditional astrologers of the past, in contrast, considered the four elements of Antiquity and their qualities as these manifested in human health and behaviour. The four temperaments are:

Choleric (hot and dry) equates to the fire element and the signs Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.
Sanguine (hot and moist) refers to the air element and the signs Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.
Phlegmatic (cold and moist) connotes the water element as well as Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.
Melancholic (cold and dry) indicates the earth element, and Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.
The four temperaments in traditional medical astrology also refer to the four humours of Antiquity, or bodily fluids believed to govern health and disposition. The most commonly described fluids were:

Empedocles's model
The following table shows the four humors with their corresponding elements, seasons, sites of formation, and resulting temperaments:

Humor	Season	Age	Element	Organ	Temperaments
Blood	Spring	Infancy	Air	Liver	Warm and moist	Sanguine
Yellow bile	Summer	Youth	Fire	Gallbladder	Warm and dry	Choleric
Black bile	Autumn	Adulthood	Earth	Spleen	Cold and dry	Melancholic
Phlegm	Winter	Old age	Water	Brain/Lungs	Cold and moist	Phlegmatic
Fire: "yellow bile" could promote anger or peevishness.
Air: blood symbolized courage and optimism.
Water: phlegm made the disposition calm and placid.
Earth: '"black bile made people sad ("melancholic") or irritable.

The four humors and their qualities
Western medicine
The humoralist system of medicine was highly individualistic, for all patients were said to have their own unique humoral composition. From Hippocrates onward, the humoral theory was adopted by Greek, Roman and Islamic Medicine, and dominated the view of the human body among European physicians until at least 1543 when it was first seriously challenged by Andreas Vesalius, who mostly criticized Galen's theories of human anatomy and not the chemical hypothesis of behavioural regulation (temperament).

Typical 18th-century practices such as bloodletting a sick person or applying hot cups to a person were based on the humoral theory of imbalances of fluids (blood and bile in those cases). Methods of treatment like bloodletting, emetics and purges were aimed at expelling a surplus of a humor. Apocroustics were medications intended to stop the flux of malignant humors to a diseased body part.


The Colericus in the Tuebinger Hausbuch (1550)

The Phlegnaticus in the Tuebinger Hausbuch
16th-century Swiss physician Paracelsus further developed the idea that beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals and various alchemical combinations thereof. These beliefs were the foundation of mainstream Western medicine well into the 17th century. Specific minerals or herbs were used to treat ailments simple to complex, from an uncomplicated upper respiratory infection to the plague. For example, chamomile was used to decrease heat, and lower excessive bile humor. Arsenic was used in a poultice bag to 'draw out' the excess humor(s) that led to symptoms of the plague. Apophlegmatisms, in pre-modern medicine, were medications chewed in order to draw away phlegm and humors.

Although advances in cellular pathology and chemistry criticized humoralism by the 17th century, the theory had dominated Western medical thinking for more than 2,000 years. Only in some instances did the theory of humoralism wane into obscurity. One such instance occurred in the sixth and seventh centuries in the Byzantine Empire when traditional secular Greek culture gave way to Christian influences. Though the use of humoralist medicine continued during this time, its influence was diminished in favor of religion. The revival of Greek humoralism, owing in part to changing social and economic factors, did not begin until the early ninth century.

If the patient's four humours got out of balance, doctors believed that illness or personality disorders could result. Temperament had further associations, such as with the seasons and Planets. The Sun, for example, is hot and dry while the Moon is cold and moist. Belief in astrological influences over the humours, health, and personality was one reason why the predominant Christian authorities permitted medieval and renaissance medical students to study astrology.

The four personality types still retain some currency in the English language. For example, sang as the French root for "blood" appears in the English word "sanguine", meaning optimistic. The medical system of India retains a similar system of astrological correspondences. Traditional astrologers today look at temperament as an alternative to psychology in analysing people's dispositions.

In fact, Ophiuchus touches the ecliptic
Ophiuchus is a large constellation straddling the celestial equator. Its name comes from the "serpent-bearer", and it is commonly represented as a man grasping a snake. The snake is represented by the constellation Serpens.

Ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. An old alternative name for the constellation was Serpentarius.

Location
Ophiuchus lies between the constellations of Aquila, Serpens, Scorpius, Sagittarius. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent; the interposition of his body divides the constellation Serpens into two parts, Serpens Caput (the snake's head) and Serpens Cauda (the snake's tail).

History
The supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9 October 1604, near θ Ophiuchi. Johannes Kepler saw it first on 16 October and studied it so extensively that the supernova was subsequently called Kepler's Supernova. He published his findings in a book titled De stella nova in pede Serpentarii (On the New Star in Ophiuchus's Foot). Galileo used its brief appearance to counter the Aristotelian dogma that the heavens are changeless.

At the beginning of 1995, the international media reported that a thirteenth constellation and therefore sign of the sidereal zodiac between Scorpio and Sagittarius had been discovered: Ophiuchus or the Serpent Bearer. Opponents of astrology viewed this news as confirmation of their skepticism of astrology and declared the zodiac used by astrologers to be obsolete. The scientist Jacqueline Mitton from the Royal Astronomical Society of Great Britain was credited with making the discovery, but she later distanced herself from the claim that the 'Serpent Bearer' was a new astronomical discovery.[1] In actual fact, it can be found plotted in the same position on 2000 year old astronomical maps, but she nevertheless continued to hold that its existence meant that the astrological division into twelve signs had lost all legitimacy. The charge of a "thirteenth sign" ignored by astrologers re-emerged in 2011, with fresh criticism in the US from the Minnesota Planetarium Society, which its spokesman subsequently retracted.

The reference to a thirteenth constellation as an argument against astrology ignores the fact that even in Antiquity western astrology used an equal twelve-fold division of the ecliptic based on the astronomical relationship between the Sun and the Earth defined by equinoxes and solstices, i.e. the tropical zodiac. Due to the precession of the equinoxes the signs are no longer attached to the stars grouped into the constellations for which they were named. The constellation Ophiuchus occupies only a narrow band along the ecliptic, and its space is covered by the signs of Scorpio and Sagittarius. Mirror axis

Mythology of the star constellation
Liz Greene[2]: The Crab has a curious mythic heritage. The Greeks perceived it as the creature of the goddess Hera, guardian of the family and the hearth. This sophisticated goddess protected those who honored the bonds of marriage, but was the jealous and implacable enemy of the illegitimate children her husband Zeus fathered on mortal women.

When the hero Heracles, one of Zeus' illicit progeny, was battling the Lernaean Hydra, she sent her crab to bite the hero's foot, to distract him during the fight. The crab caught hold of Hercules' heel with its powerful pincers and could not be shaken off. Although Hercules managed to conquer the Hydra, Hera placed her valiant crustacean in the heavens in gratitude for its loyalty.

The crab's association with Hera reflects one of Cancer's best-known meanings, for Hera was the primary Greek symbol of domestie stability and continuity through the preservation of family bonds.

In Egyptian myth, however, the zodiacal sign of Cancer took a subtler form. Instead of a crab, a scarab or dung beetle was associated with this segment of the zodiac which begins at the summer solstice, when the Sun is at the zenith of its power. The scarab is a more mysterious image than the crab, and gives us deeper insight into Cancer's complex nature. Because this beetle lays its eggs in a ball of dung which it rolls about until the larvae hatch, the Egyptians perceived it as a solar symbol from which new life mysteriously emerged, and understood the sign of Cancer to reflect the incarnation of the spirit into mortal form.

Thus the first of the water signs is associated with the mystery of the spiritual source of life and with emotional loyalty to the values of the past.

Interpretation
Cancer is the fourth sign of the zodiac. It is associated with empathetic and maternal qualities. It is sensitive to impressions rising from the depths of the soul. It embodies a world of images and dreams which is difficult to put into words or describe in any kind of concrete way. And although this world is ever present, other signs generally find it more difficult to access than the imaginative and sensitive individuals born under the sign of Cancer.

The energy of Cancer is introverted in nature, and Cancerians usually prefer moments of quiet contemplation in which they can sense the more subtle aspects of life. They can passively receive impressions and reflect them back.

Taking care of others and being taken care of are also important themes in the lives of those with the sign of Cancer dominant in their horoscopes. They want to make their loved ones feel warm and secure and expect the same in return. They enjoy the company of children and can empathise with them because they have not lost contact with their own inner child, which can also mean that they are sometimes reluctant to grow up themselves.

They have a fine intuition and are always receptive to the moods of others, which can sometimes cause them to be moody. Their need for emotional contact can sometimes lead them to unintentionally manipulate other people, and because of their strongly emotional nature, they are sometimes in danger of rejecting all appeals to reason, only allowing their feelings to guide their actions. They often build up a thick emotional shell with which to hide and protect their sensitive, impressionable, shy and vulnerable core from being hurt or completely at the mercy of others. If they feel that it will help them to reach their goals, Cancerians are able to retreat into their rigid shells. They are also in a figurative and literal sense strongly orientated towards the past, and can tend to be rather conservative. For them the past is often equally as important as the present because for them past experiences continue into the present. These may often be related to earlier experiences and relationships in childhood, especially to the mother, but also other events and relationships outside the family.


Andy Warhol's Cancer
Planets and axes in the sign of Cancer exhibit sensitive, imaginative, nurturing and to a certain extent childlike qualities.

Cancer, together with the other two water signs, Scorpio and Pisces, is highly sensitive and tuned in to the world of emotions. But where the qualities of Cancer are reminiscent of the Sea out of which all life developed, Scorpio could be compared to a deep muddy swamp out of which the lotus flower grows, and Pisces to a slowly meandering stream. Both Cancer and its polar opposite sign Capricorn are associated with aspects of society: in Cancer's case it is the smallest unit, namely the family, whereas with Capricorn these are the general structures and laws upon which society is based. Cancer can learn valuable lessons from the signs that form natural square aspects to it: from Aries the ability to take direct action, and from Libra the ability to socialise with ease.

Mythology of the constellation
The constellation shows a creature with the head and front legs of a goat and the tail of a fish. The Babylonians were already aware of this symbolism which unites earth and water, the material and the emotional. C.G. Jung writes "The Sun climbs like a goat up the highest mountain and is like a fish in the depths of the ocean". Sometimes the goat is associated with the unicorn, an ancient symbol for the higher worlds to which the Capricorn aspires to climb.

In ancient mythology, Capricorn is related to the god Pan. He is the son of Hermes and is one of the Satyrs, human-like creatures with the horns and legs of a ram and a horses tail. He was raised by nymphs after his mother, disgusted by his appearance, abandoned him. Pan tended sheep and goats and was a talented musician. His libidinous nature also drove him to go after the nymphs who usually fled in panic at the sight of him. When the nymph Syrinx was no longer able to flee him she begged to be turned into reed which Pan used to create the well-known Pan flute. At one time Pan himself was fleeing from the monster Typhon and tried but failed to turn himself into a fish. However, he supported Zeus in his battle with Typhon, and in thanks Zeus immortalised him by transforming him into a star constellation.

Liz Greene[2]: The goat is a deeply paradoxical image in myth. A goat called Amalthea suckled the infant Zeus, and when he became king of the gods he placed her horn - the Cornucopia - in the heavens as an image of the earth's abundance.

Goats were also symbols of licentiousness, and the great goat god Pan, with his wild train of satyrs, personified the uncontrolled life-force expressed as human lust. As pagan appreciation of nature gave way to Christian devaluing of instinctual life, the lascivious goat of Pan became the scapegoat, the animal embodiment of human failure and imperfection.

Saturn, planetary ruler of Capricorn, was, like Amalthea, a personification of the riches of the earth, and in Greco-Roman myth he presided over the Golden Age, when human beings lived in harmony with natural law. Yet Saturn was also the god of time who set the limits of mortal life, and thus embodied not only the abundance of nature but also its grim mortality.

The sign of Capricorn begins at the winter solstice, when the nights are longest and the sense of hope is at its lowest ebb. At this time of darkness and despair the mythic Sun god was reborn each year. The profound symbolism of light reborn from the darkness may be seen not only in Christian imagery, but also in the figures of Mithras and Sol Invictus, who shared a birthday with Jesus and were, like him, dominant in the religious life of the late Roman Empire.

Thus the mythic backdrop of Capricorn the Goat expresses many levels of meaning, from the sensuous abundance of the earth to the inevitability of death, and the hope of redemption that is born when the sense of mortality is most acute. Capricorn is a sign of both darkness and light, structure and abandonment. It is not surprising that those in whom the sign is prominent often have such difficulty in understanding the apparently contradictory facets of their own nature.

Interpretation
Capricorn is the tenth sign of the zodiac. It is concerned with the social sphere. The individual is part of society and must adhere to certain rules - while at the same time acting responsibly.

People born with an emphasis on this sign are very good at understanding the duties that come with being part of society: They generally adhere to the existing rules and regulations and they crave social recognition for the work they do for society. They are able to take on responsibilities, concentrate on what is necessary and essential and work hard. They persevere and are very patient because they are able to concentrate on long-term goals and greater social roles. They are dedicated, hard working and able to put up with long periods without success in order to finally achieve what they long for. They are disciplined and want to get to the heart of any matter and they generally contribute to upholding existing social structures and order.

Capricorns are sometimes in danger of sacrificing their ethical principles in order to achieve their goals, and their motto is sometimes: "The ends justify the means". Their sense of duty can also lead them to neglect other areas of their lives which can sometimes cause them to develop a dour and hard attitude to life.

One of the shadow aspects of Capricorn is its tendency to worship rules and regulations which can cause them to overlook alternative individual solutions to social problems.

And finally, Capricorns tend to revere tradition and try to conserve those things which they feel have stood the test of time.

Any planets or axes in the sign of Capricorn exhibit the Capricornian qualities of being serious, persevering and tough.

Both Capricorn and its opposite sign of Cancer are orientated towards the past: In Cancer's case this is the family history, whereas Capricorn is interested in the existing social structures. Capricorn, like the other earth signs Taurus and Virgo, is pragmatic: Taurus is pragmatic in the service of comfort, Virgo has a pragmatic attitude towards everyday life and Capricorn uses pragmatism in order to advance its social standing. Capricorn can learn important lessons from the two signs that stand in archetypal square to it: From Aries the art of being spontaneous and from Libra the appreciation of beauty.

The zodiacal signs' decans[1]
Threefold division of each sign of the zodiac into 10 degree segments, sometimes called decanates or Faces. The first decan is from 0-9 degrees 59 minutes, the second 10-19 degrees 59 minutes and the third from 20-29 degrees 59 minutes.

History
In ancient Egypt the decan system originated as part of their calendar system. Initially the decans were stars that could be observed to rise at 10-day intervals. The Egyptian calendar had 360 days marked by decan stars rising at 10-day intervals, plus five inter-calculated days. Ancient Hellenistic astrologers eventually dropped the Fixed Star association, and simply divided each 30-degree Zodiac Sign into three equal segments.

Today there are different methods for determining the decan Ruler. In the so-called Triplicity system commonly used in Modern Astrology the first decan of any sign is the ruler of the whole sign. The ruler of the second decan is the ruler of the next sign in the same Element, and the third decan rules the sign after that in the same element. This gives rise to a systematic pattern of decan rulers.

Examples:

First decan of Aries - ruler: Mars/ Aries
Second decan of Aries - ruler: Sun/ Leo
Third decan of Aries - ruler: Jupiter/ Sagittarius
First decan of Taurus - ruler: Venus/ Taurus
Second decan of Taurus - ruler: Mercury/ Virgo
Third decan of Taurus - ruler: Saturn/ Capricorn
First decan of Sagittarius - ruler: Jupiter/ Sagittarius
Second decan of Sagittarius - ruler: Mars/ Aries
Third decan of Sagittarius - ruler: Sun/ Leo
The decans give a bit more flavour or character to the zodiac signs. For example, a planet in the second decan of Sagittarius takes on a little of the assertive quality of Aries.

Chaldean Order Method of Decans
Yet the first, and apparently older method, is to assign one of the seven visible planets to each of the decans based on the Chaldean order of the planets. This method is frequently used in traditional western sources, from the 1st century through the 17th century CE.

So in traditional and Horary Astrology, the decans are often called "faces" and each 10-degree segment of a sign has a different planetary ruler (according to the Chaldean Order) .

The faces are considered minor essential dignities and are the least influential.

The assignments of this scheme are those of the seventeenth century horary astrologer William Lilly:


The Chaldean order[2]
Aries: Mars Sun Venus
Taurus: Mercury Moon Saturn
Gemini: Jupiter Mars Sun
Cancer: Venus Mercury Moon
Leo: Saturn Jupiter Mars
Virgo: Sun Venus Mercury
Libra: Moon Saturn Jupiter
Scorpio: Mars Sun Venus
Sagittarius: Mercury Moon Saturn
Capricorn: Jupiter Mars Sun
Aquarius: Venus Mercury Moon
Pisces: Saturn Jupiter Mars
Triplicity Method of Decans[3]
The second method, which appears to have been developed somewhat later than the first, involves dividing each of the signs into thirds, and then making the assignments based on the other signs that are in the same Triplicity.

In this method the first 10 degrees of each sign belongs to the sign itself, while the second 10 degrees of the sign is associated with the next sign in zodiacal order that is of the same triplicity or element, and then the last 10 degrees of the sign is associated with the third sign in zodiacal order that is of the same triplicity.

For example, the first decan of Aries, from 0 to 10 degrees, belongs to Aries itself. The second 10 degrees of Aries, from 10 to 20 degrees, belongs to Leo, which is the next fire sign. The third 10 degrees of Aries, from 20 to 30 degrees, belongs to Sagittarius, which is the next fire sign after Leo.

This second method appears to have been used by Indian astrologers from a very early stage, although it was not until the 20th century that it became popular with western astrologers. In Modern Astrology the second method appears to have more widespread acceptance than the first.

Mythology of the constellation
Liz Greene[3]: Sagittarius, the last of the fire signs, coincides with the increasing darkness of early winter. As the landscape becomes starker and the year moves toward its end, external activity is curtailed and the world of the imagination comes alive.

The sign of Sagittarius is linked with the mythic centaur, whose origins go back to Babylon, and who is found in the figure of Chiron among the pantheon of the planetary gods. The centaur's duality is reflected in the contradictory nature of the sign, for it possesses both the raw vigor and power of the horse and the aspiring vision of the human spirit.

The name Sagittarius comes from the Latin word for arrow, sagitta. The centaur's arrow, flying toward some distant goal, is an image of his quest for greater understanding, not only of his own mythic wound, but also of a universe in which the gods are just, though suffering and death are still part of the condition of all living things.

Half beast and half divine, the centaur embodies the paradox of the human animal whose powerful and potentially destructive instincts are guided by hopes, ideals and a world-view which recognizes the sanctity of life.

In myth, centaurs could be rowdy and uncontrollable, especially when drunk. Yet the arrow of Sagittarius in the heavens is aimed directly at the heart of Scorpio, thus suggesting that the centaur's enlightened vision can illuminate those darker human passions that lead us into blind destructiveness.

Sagittarius is usually seen as being related to the centaurs, creatures with a human upper-body and the lower-body of a horse. In mythology the centaurs stand for the ambivalence between the unconscious world of animal instincts and the conscious, intellectual and cultural world of humans. This made them unpredictable. Some of them, in particular Chiron, were highly cultivated and sought spiritual enlightenment. Chiron was both a teacher and a student who continually sought to increase his knowledge. Others were instinctive, quarrelsome and enjoyed drinking and raping. In their wild attacks on Hercules they usually came off worse.

According to another version, the constellation is related to the Satyre Krotos, a human-like creature with the tail of a horse and the horns and legs of a ram who invented the bow. He grew up among the muses and was the son of their wet nurse. Similarly ambivalent characteristics were attributed to the Satyrs as were attributed to the Centaurs. They could be civilised and responsible, but also wild and uninhibited.


Johfra Bosschart's Sagittarius
Interpretation
Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac. It is concerned with integrating knowledge into a greater whole. Sagittarius gazes into the distance - it is orientated towards the future and strives to discover the meaning in everything. It perceives the world in a holistic manner.

Individuals with an emphasis of this sign are always trying to broaden their horizons, whether by travelling and getting to know foreign cultures or immersing themselves in philosophy. They want to form their own picture of the world and collect knowledge to this end. However, their aim is not to collect as many facts as possible but to understand their meaning and how they come together to form a more encompassing whole. This is the reason why they are often interested in religion and spirituality. Faith and experience is more important to them than knowledge. Their optimism can sometimes cause them to forget that life also has some more unpleasant aspects and that lows follow highs. The optimism of Sagittarian individuals can be infectious although their optimism is sometimes followed by periods of deep depression without them quite knowing why.

Sagittarian individuals need convictions. And they are very good at carrying others along on their wave of enthusiasm. However, this can sometimes turn negative: when belief turns into fanaticism and the need to convert others or when self-righteousness takes over.

Axes and planets in the sign of Sagittarius take on Sagittarian characteristics such as optimism, greatness and farsightedness. Sagittarius shares the quality of versatility with its opposite sign Gemini. But whereas for Gemini this can be an end in itself, for Sagittarius it is a means to an end: namely to achieve a greater understanding. Sagittarius, together with the other two fire signs Aries and Leo, has the ability to actively change the course of life. Aries gives the impulse, Leo is the centre of attention and Sagittarius passes on the idea. Sagittarius can learn valuable lessons from the signs that are in archetypal square to it: from Virgo the attention to detail and from Pisces the trust in the flow of life.

Mercury is in detriment in Sagittarius.

Got it! You’ve basically pasted a massive overview of temperament theory, the four humours, the zodiac signs’ elements, decans, and some mythological and interpretive context for signs like Cancer, Capricorn, and Sagittarius. It’s a mix of traditional humoral astrology, classical mythology, and modern astrological interpretations. Here’s a concise breakdown so you can see the structure and relationships clearly:

1. Temperaments & Humours
Choleric (hot & dry → Fire → Aries, Leo, Sagittarius → Yellow bile → Summer → Youth → Gallbladder): Ambitious, energetic, sometimes irritable.

Sanguine (hot & moist → Air → Gemini, Libra, Aquarius → Blood → Spring → Infancy → Liver): Optimistic, social, courageous.

Phlegmatic (cold & moist → Water → Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces → Phlegm → Winter → Old age → Brain/Lungs): Calm, nurturing, reflective.

Melancholic (cold & dry → Earth → Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn → Black bile → Autumn → Adulthood → Spleen): Serious, disciplined, introspective.

Historical context: Humours dominated medicine until the 17th century. Treatments like bloodletting, herbs, and apophlegmatisms were intended to balance these humours. Astrology was intertwined with medicine; planets and seasons were thought to affect humours.

2. Elements & Triplicities
Fire: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius → passionate, energetic, action-oriented.

Earth: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn → practical, disciplined, grounded.

Air: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius → intellectual, social, communicative.

Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces → emotional, intuitive, nurturing.

Triplicity rulership: Each element has three signs. Modern astrology often emphasizes the element first to gauge temperament.

3. Decans
Each zodiac sign is divided into three 10° segments.

Triplicity Method: 1st decan → sign itself, 2nd decan → next sign of same element, 3rd decan → third sign of same element.

Chaldean Method: Older system using planetary order (Mars, Sun, Venus, etc.) to rule decans.

Decans add nuance, flavor, and subtle personality shifts within a sign.

Astronomy
There are no prominent stars in the constellation, with the brightest stars being of only fourth magnitude. One star in the constellation, Alpha Piscium, is also known as Alrescha, which comes from the Arabic الرشآء al-rišā’, meaning "the well rope," or "the cord."

Mythology of the constellation
The constellation of Pisces shows two fish with their tails bound together swimming in opposite directions. The Babylonians identified the northern fish with their goddess Inanna - the planet Venus. In Greek mythology, these fish are also associated with Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of beauty and love. She made her escape from the terrible monster Typhon which the Earth goddess Gaia, in a fit of rage, set loose upon the gods. Aphrodite was hiding in the reeds of the banks of the river Euphrates with her son Eros (Cupid) when two fish swam past and brought them both to safety. According to another version, Aphrodite and Eros transformed themselves into two fish to escape Typhon and are forever bound together.

Liz Greene[3]: In Syrian myth, the larger fish of Pisces was associated with the great fertiliy godess, Derke or Atargatis, portrayed with a women's head upon a huge fish's body.

The Greeks identified this deity with their own Aphrodite, and believed the smaller fish to be her beautiful young lover, Adonis, who was killed by a boar. These two figures, bound together in the heavens, symbolized the great yearly cycle, in which the youthful spirit of newly emerging vegetative life emerged from the fertile womb of nature in the spring and died in the autumn, only to be reborn in the following spring.

This eternal cycle of birth, death and rebirth, expressed through the rhythms of the natural world, also portrayed a profound truth about the nature of human beings. The larger fish became a symbol of the mortal body, with its insatiable appetites and blind instinetual needs. The smaller fish, associated with the goddess' ill-fated lover, became an image of the redemptive power of the immortal spirit which, although trapped in the cycle of mortality, is eternally reborn.

The spiritual symbolism of the smaller fish was also reflected in the semi-divine figure of Orpheus the Fisher, in Greco-Roman myth, around whose tragic life a redeemer-cult was formed. The image of the fish as sacrificial savior or spiritual redeemer found its way into the iconography of early Christianity, where Jesus was himself the Fish and Peter the Fisher of Men.

The mythic imagery of Pisces portrays to us the mystery of an immortal spirit which, although imprisoned in the darkness of the physical world, is forever redeemed and reborn.

The constellation Pisces appears in a part of the sky known anciently as "the sea." This region included Cetus the whale; Andromeda, a beautiful woman chained to a rock in the sea; as well as the half-goat half-fish Capricorn. Winter in the Mediterranean region is the rainy season, suggesting a celestial source for the rains occurring when the sun was in constellations of this region of the sky.


The sign of Pisces in the view of Johfra Bosschart
Interpretation
Pisces is the twelfth and last Sign of the Zodiac. To spiritual astrologers, this is where the individual desires to merge with a larger whole that goes beyond the limitations of human existence.

Pisces is a mutable water sign, meaning that Pisces planets are apt to be flexible and adaptable, and to operate primarily through the emotions. Traditionally Venus is exalted in Pisces, in keeping with her mythology. Mercury, in Domicile and exaltation in Virgo, is in its Fall in its opposite sign of Pisces. This does not indicate that people with Mercury in Pisces lack intelligence! It does say something about how their intelligence is likely to be expressed: with an imaginative "big picture" approach, more than an aptitude for analytical fact-finding.

People born with an emphasis of Horoscope factors in Pisces tend to have a powerful imagination and intuition. Spirituality may play an important role in their lives, under Neptunian longing to merge with the divine.

They also tend to have a strong social conscience. They can selflessly help others in need and, because they experience the suffering of others as if it were their own, can sacrifice their own needs to help them. More so than most signs, Pisces can accept people as they are, with all of their imperfections, rather than wanting to change them or avoid them. Pisces individuals have a deep sense of unity of all life and connection of all people. Pisceans also tend to be extremely sensitive to the emotional state of people around them.

There is a danger that such individuals find it difficult to differentiate between where their own boundaries end and those of others start. Because their longing to dissolve these boundaries is so strong, they can tend to ignore their own needs and let other people impose upon them.

Pisces individuals are often dreamers, with a tendency towards escapism of some sort. This might be a pleasant hobby (such as reading science fiction) but if they remain unaware or unhappy they can succumb to addictive behavior, in which drugs or alcohol offer the sense of euphoria and ego-annihilation that spirituality or service to others provide in a healthier way.

In common with the other mutable signs, Pisces individuals have the ability to adapt to their environment. The Virgoan adapts to the conditions given, adjusts his expectations accordingly, and then tries to improve the circumstances. In contrast, the Piscean identifies with them. Pisces shares with the other water signs a developed sensitivity to feelings. Cancer is profoundly aware of the emotional depths, Scorpio is aware of the depths of existence, and Pisces is acutely aware of the interconnectedness of all existence.

Psychological astrology finds a similar mystical desire in Neptune, the modern ruler of Pisces; whereas the traditional ruler Jupiter suggests an approach more in keeping with conventional theology and philosophy. Scorpio

Mythology of the Constellation
Liz Greene[2]: The Scorpion of Greek myth is a menacing creature, sent by the lunar goddess Artemis to kill the hunter Orion as a punishment for his pride. It also caused the disastrous bolting of the steeds of Apollo, as they galloped wildly across the heavens when his inexperienced son Phaethon tried to commandeer the solar chariot: the earth was scorched and Phaëthon was hurled to his death.

In early Mesopotamia, the Scorpion was known as the Stinger, the symbol of darkness which heralded the decline of the Sun's power in the autumn. It is thus connected with the chthonic powers of nature, which will rise up in anger if abused by the arrogant will of human beings. Both Orion and Phaëthon were guilty of what the Greeks called hubris - the pride which afflicts heroic souls, and makes them push beyond their appropriate limits to challenge the will and power of the gods.

Although portrayed in myth as a dangerous creature, the Scorpion is not evil. The symbolism of the second water sign reflects the vengeance of outraged nature, and the stern justice which awaits those who lack humility in the face of the instinctual forces of life. As harbinger of the Sun's decline, Scorpio embodies the law of nature which decrees that even the strongest will must ultimately bow to the body's mortality.

The image of the Scorpion was also adopted by the Roman Praetorian Guard as their emblem, in part because one of its planetary rulers is the war god Mars (the other being the underworld god Pluto), and in part because the cunning, speed and lethal sting of the scorpion reflected the image these crack troops of the Empire wished their enemies to bear in mind.

The myths connected with Scorpio are closely related to the primitive hunter Orion who was both libidinous and a keen hunter. After he raped his mother in law he was blinded by her husband King Oinopion but regained his sight with the help of the divine blacksmith Hephaistos. He then immediately went about avenging himself by attacking all of nature. Artemis, the Moon goddess of the wilderness, the hunt and wild animals, was so worried that Orion would destroy the animal kingdom that she created a giant scorpion which killed Orion with one sting. In another version, it is said that Artemis created the scorpion in self defence because Orion tried to rape her. Whatever the case, the primitive hunter was killed by a creature that is itself considered to be one of the oldest and most primitive creatures.

Because of their animosity towards each other, the constellations of Orion and Scorpio never appear in the night sky at the same time.

Interpretation
Scorpio is the eighth sign of the zodiac. It is also considered to be one of the most enigmatic signs due to the wide variety of ways in which it can find expression.

Whether a Scorpio person feels driven by instincts or takes on the form of a phoenix and rises to the highest heights, he/she is always able to go through a process of regeneration and start something completely new. This individual lives passionately and intensely but it requires a high level of maturity in order not to destroy those things he/she covets or loves the most.

Individuals with an emphasis of this sign tend towards extremes of behaviour. Their motto is often 'everything or nothing'! Others are rarely aware of their intensity of feelings because no matter how much they might be simmering inside they can put on a calm facade. Their intensity often drives them to devote themselves totally to any social causes they feel passionate about, and they tend to make a dramatic impression while doing so.

They are interested in anything which seems profound or mysterious, for taboo themes and the depths of being. Their interest is awakened where others turn away in horror or disgust.

The subject of power in all its subtle and covert forms is of great significance. They may believe that by manipulating others they have have power over them, but this only leads them into the very state of dependency they so dread.


The sign of Scorpio in the view of Johfra Bosschart
Finally, Scorpio individuals possess great powers of healing with which they can help not only themselves but also others.

Planets and axes in the sign of Scorpio have a profound and intense quality.

Scorpio and Taurus are both passionate signs, but whereas Taurus is passionate about experiencing the sensual aspects of life, Scorpio is passionately interested in getting to the bottom of existence. The water signs of Cancer, Pisces and Scorpio are all very intuitive and empathic. Cancerians are very empathic towards their loved ones. Scorpio can sense where others are vulnerable and use this ability to either hurt or heal. Pisces feels at one with all of humanity and ultimately nature itself. Scorpio can learn valuable lessons from the two signs that stand archetypally in square to it: From Leo, Scorpio can learn to express its innate energies, and from Aquarius it can learn to use these in a constructive manner for the good of society.

Van Gogh - The Starry Night
A group of adjacent fixed stars, usually interpreted as an imaginary figure such as Leo the lion or Cetus the whale. Star formations have been interpreted by different cultures since ancient times. Today there are 88 officially recognised star constellations. However, only twelve constellations along the sun's pathway across the heavens (the ecliptic) are the zodiacal constellations of greatest interest to astrology.

The star constellations along the ecliptic gave the signs of the zodiac their names but are not identical with them. A sign is a simple 30-degree band along the ecliptic. When the zodiac was developed in ancient Babylon the zodiacal signs and constellations were in roughly the same positions from the viewpoint of earth. However, the precession of the equinoxes caused the signs to move in relation to the sun-based tropical zodiac so that they are now about one sign apart. The fixed star-based sidereal zodiac used by Hindu and some western astrologers is more or less constellation-based. Because zodiac constellations occupy different widths along the ecliptic whereas signs are always 30 degrees, the sign-constellation match is not identical even in the sidereal zodiac.

This sign-constellation discrepancy sometimes leads critics to assume, incorrectly, that astrologers work with the "wrong" constellations. The critics argue, for example, that someone's sun in Leo is actually in Cancer because the sun appeared against the backdrop of the constellation of Cancer at his time of birth. Another common sign-constellation confusion is in the assumption that the constellation Ophiuchus (which touches the ecliptic) must be a missing "13th sign."

The critics ignore that Western astrologers work with the tropical zodiac signs and not the star constellations which gave the signs of the zodiac their names. Thus the first sign of Aries always begins at the spring equinox and the following circle of signs on the sun's ecliptic is divided into twelve equal segments.

Today some astrologers work with planets' and sensitive points' conjunctions to fixed stars, as part of astrology's ancient Mesopotamian legacy of gazing at the constellations. Sun Sign

The Sun signs and their months[1]
Synonym: Star Sign

Common term used for the sign of the zodiac which the Sun was in at the time of an individual's birth.
If someone says, "I am a Leo," or "She is a Capricorn," he refers to the person's sun sign.

Sun signs are the basis of most popular astrology such as newspaper astrology columns, but professional astrologers see sun signs as too simplistic on their own to substitute for a full horoscope interpretation that includes all of the planets, houses/ axes and additional sensitive points.

"Sign of the zodiac" however remains the correct term, whereas the term "star sign" blurs the distinction between zodiac sign and star constellation.
Originally (about two thousand years ago), the star constellations were equivalent to the star signs. Taurus

The bull's head[2]

Mythology of the star constellation
Liz Greene[3]: The bull is one of the most ancient symbols of the strength and fertilizing power of nature. All over the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the bull was worshiped as the consort of the earth goddess, and a vivid portrayal of these rites comes down to us in the frescoes of the bull dance, so beautifully portrayed at Knossos, in Crete. The animal's blend of slow, patient movement, and terrifying power when angered, epitomized the benign and destructive faces of the forces of nature.

When Zeus desired the beautiful Phoenician princess, he transformed himself into a magnificent white bull. After enticing her to sit on his back he rose and fled with her to Crete where he revealed his true identity and took her as his lover. Minos, who was one of their sons, became the king of Crete. During a dispute with his brothers he called on Poseidon to help him and the latter agreed in return for a fitting sacrifice. For this purpose Poseidon had a pristine white bull rise from the waters but Minos was so taken with the bull that he was unwilling to sacrifice it. Poseidon took revenge for this broken oath by causing Minos' wife Pasiphae, who was the daughter of the sun god Helios, to fall in love with the bull. Pasiphae had the Athenian artificer Daedalus construct a hollow wooden cow in which she could hide in order to copulate with the bull. She then gave birth to the Minotaur, a monstrous creature with the upper body of a bull and the lower one of a human. The Minotaur demanded human sacrifices and so was kept in a labyrinth built by Daedalus to protect the inhabitants of Crete. Eventually, Theseus managed to kill the Minotaur with the help of Minos' daughter Ariadne.

A further myth associated with the constellation of Taurus concerns Io, the daughter of Inachus. Zeus also took her as a lover and transformed her into a cow to protect her from the fury of his wife Hera.

The Greek god, Poseidon, ruler of earthquakes, was worshiped in the form of a giant black bull who lived in the depths of the earth and shook the ground when he stamped in anger. Here, the raw forces of nature are perceived as inimical to the heroic will, for instinctual compulsions erode self-reliance and undermine the capacity to direct one's life.

In the Mithraie mysteries of the late Roman Empire, the bull became the clear symbol of primitive human passions, which had to be sacrificed to open the door to a higher level of consciousness.

The Buddha, according to legend, was born under Taurus, and the image of the taming of the bull feures in many Buddhist tales. Taurus in myth is thus both an embodiment of earth's creative potency, and the eternal challenge of the instincts to the human will and spirit.

Interpretation
Taurus is the second sign of the zodiac. It is concerned with pausing and comprehending the physical world through the senses: taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell. Individuals with an emphasis of this sign in their natal charts are very sensual, passionately devoted to the world of sensual pleasures and are very physical. The basic principle could be described as "the longing to absorb sensually", and both the physical world and the realm of material values play an important role: The motto here is possession or being able to call something my own.

Taurus individuals may be slow to act but their actions are thorough and usually have long-lasting effects. They are reliable and can really get stuck in when they want to. They prefer to be surrounded by people they are familiar with. Their need for security can sometimes cause them to cling to possessions or become jealous and possessive in relationships. Taureans are very patient and have great stamina. This makes them thoughtful, contemplative and calm on the one hand, but can also make them stubborn and inflexible, which can sometimes stand in the way of their own progress. They are conservative and protective and tend to be more interested in what they are familiar with than new and unknown things which have yet to prove their reliability. Their personal boundaries are important to them and they are determined to defend them.


Taurus in the view of Bosschart
Taurus individuals have an air of calm and are good at persevering during difficult times. If they bottle up their frustrations for too long, they are liable to explode with an intensity that shocks those around them. This shows the potential darker side of this sign which is symbolised by the Minotaur in the Greek myths.

Any planets or axes in this sign of zodiac will exhibit Taurean qualities such as patience, reliability and sensuality.

Taurus shares with the other two earth signs Virgo and Capricorn a sense of what is practically possible. It feels at home in lush green meadows where it can relax and allow its senses to soak up the surrounding nature, whereas Virgo separates the wheat from the chaff at harvest time and Capricorn climbs into the barren heights of the mountains. Taurus shares with its opposite sign Scorpio an interest in physical pleasure, although with Taurus the emphasis is on indulgence and enjoyment of these, whereas Scorpio is more interested in the deeper transformational power of sexuality. The two signs in archetypal square aspect to Taurus can teach it valuable lessons: From Leo Taurus can learn the art of self-presentation, and from Aquarius the ability to be different to others and still belong.

Clock at St. Marks Basilica in Venice.
The zodiac which begins at the spring equinox. The spring equinox is the point at which the Sun crosses the celestial equator from South to North on its apparent path around the Earth. In the northern hemisphere the spring equinox is equivalent to 0 degrees of Aries and the point opposite (the autumnal equinox) to 0 degrees Libra. When the Sun is at either 0 degrees of Aries or 0 degrees of Libra the length of daylight hours are the same for every location on the Earth's surface.

The other important "turning points" on the Sun's apparent path around the Earth are the two solstices: the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere at 0 degrees of Cancer and the winter solstice at 0 degrees of Capricorn. This is where the tropical zodiac gets its name: The tropical zodiac is characterised by these four critical points (Greek tropoi.)

The precession of the equinoxes causes the spring equinox to move backwards through the zodiac which is a basic difference between the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac where the latter does not move with relation to the tropical one over longer periods of time. The sidereal zodiac approximately overlaps the constellations for which the signs were named, but because the constellations are either larger or smaller than 30 degrees on the ecliptic the correspondence is imprecise. The discrepancy (called Ayanamsha in Vedic astrology) between the two is currently around 24 degrees.

Mythology of the constellation
Liz Greene[2]: The virgin goddesses of myth were not virgins in the sexual sense. In fact they were often portrayed as sensual and promiscuous. In Latin, the word virgo means ʹunmarried' or 'self-possessed', and connotes not sexual purity but a self-sufficiency which made these deities eschew wifely roles. As mistress of herself, the virgin goddess belonged to no one, and therefore acted solely from her own will, rather than as the mouthpiece or consort of a male deity.

The goddess Astraea, whose symbolism was exploited by Queen Elizabeth I as "cosmic" propaganda during her long reign, was known to the Greeks and Romans as the patron of justice and natural law, and presided over the orderly cycles of nature. Offended by the cruelty and boorishness of the human race, she abandoned the earth and withdrew into the heavens.

Earlier "virgin" goddesses, such as the Syrio-Phoenician Atargatis, were not so refined. They presided over orgiastic rites, dispensed their favors through temple prostitutes, and personified the fertile abandonment of nature. Yet they too were virgins and gave themselves to those men or gods who pleased them, rather than to those to whom they owed a wifely duty.

The virgin goddess of nature is an ancient symbol of the inviolable integrity of the earth itself. Despite our endless rape and wastage of her natural resources, the earth preserves its mystery, power and capacity for self-renewal.

There are various myths associated with the constellation of Virgo, although powerful goddesses are a dominant theme, for example Dike, the goddess of moral righteousness, Tyche, the goddess of luck or chance and Astarea, the goddess of justice and convention who abandoned the Earth as humans became more brutal.

However, Demeter is the goddess most closely associated with the sign of Virgo. She is the Greek goddess of fertility and ruler of the seasons. She was honoured particularly towards the end of summer when the golden ears of corn were harvested. She taught men how to plough and women how to grind the grain and bake bread. She was stricken by grief after her daughter Persephone was abducted by Hades (Latin: Pluto) who was aided by Zeus, and she allowed the land to become barren. Zeus feared that humanity might not survive and that nobody would be left to bring him sacrifices. He therefore made a bargain with Hades for the release of Persephone. However, when journeying back to her mother, Persephone ate a few Pomegranate seeds, the symbol of marriage and was therefore bound to Hades. Demeter had to accept sharing Persephone with Hades, and that barrenness is also an aspect of fertility. From that time forth, Persephone spent one third of the year with Hades and two thirds with her mother.


The sign of Virgo in the view of Andy Warhol
Interpretation
Virgo is the sixth sign of the zodiac. It is concerned with evaluating and utilising. Virgo is passionately devoted to details and is a keen observer of the small things, including those others might consider insignificant. Virgoans are very conscientious in everything they do and excel at creating order. They can be of service to a cause or an individual. The word service often gives rise to negative associations when in actual fact there are few individuals who do not serve in some way or another. Therefore, and because the term Virgo is associated with sexual abstinence, the sign of Virgo often has a rather bad reputation.

Typical Virgo associations are in fact misleading. According to the psychoanalyst and astrologer Liz Greene, the mythological virgin is "the archetypal image of the free woman who is first and foremost espoused to her innermost self and only secondly to a man". In this case, the prime emphasis is being true to oneself rather than carrying out the wishes of others. Virgo is especially capable of adapting to circumstances and making the best of them.

Virgo makes use of the Earth's fertility in preparation for the barren times ahead, thus taking on an important duty for the wider community - at the same time modest and aware of how indispensable this service is. She doesn't feel the need to be the centre of attention.

She may occasionally find it hard to see the wood for the trees. If this happens, she can lose herself in the details and have difficulty understanding different points of view. She can be fussy, sterile and small-minded and can be in danger of serving the needs of others while ignoring the latent inner aspects of her own life. The myth of Hades and Persephone shows that both aspects belong together.

Those born under the sign of Virgo also have healing qualities. They are very aware of the relationship between nutrition and health.

The sign of Virgo imparts the qualities of adaptability, common sense and caution to any planets or axes which are placed in this sign.

The sign of Virgo shares with its polar opposite sign Pisces the character trait of being devoted to the wider community. Virgo is dedicated to material needs whereas Pisces is devoted to spiritual ones. Virgo, along with the other two Earth signs Taurus and Capricorn, is orientated towards the physical realm. Taurus' approach is through pleasure, Virgo uses the body in order to understand physical health, and Capricorn makes use of the body to fulfil its life's task. Virgo can learn valuable lessons from the two signs squaring it. From Gemini the ability to take on several things at a time, and from Sagittarius the ability to use visions as a source of inspiration.

Zodiac in Western Astrology
The term is most commonly used in western astrology to refer to the division of the ecliptic into twelve Signs.

History
The western zodiac was originally developed and standardized so that it consisted of 12 segments consisting of 30 degrees each by the 5th century BCE in Mesopotamia. It became widely adopted by other cultures in subsequent centuries after the development of horoscopic astrology.[2]

The band of twelve zodiac signs arrayed along the ecliptic along which the sun, moon and the other planets appear to circle around the earth.

Although the signs of the zodiac were named after the 12 principal star Constellations found along the ecliptic, they are not identical to them. The constellations vary in size whereas each sign of the zodiac is a 30 degree segment within the complete zodiac of 360 degrees. The switch from observing planets against the backdrop of constellations to locating planets within sectors of the heavens named for constellations seems to have taken place in Babylonian times.

The zodiac often is depicted as a set of symbols or graphic representations of each sign. For example, Aries is shown as a ram; and Taurus as a bull. The frequency of animal signs in the zodiac attests to the common Greek root in the word zodiac and the English words "zoo" and "zoology."

Periodically Opponents of Astrology point out that additional constellations touch on the ecliptic, notably the so-called Thirteenth Constellation, Ophiuchus. This does not change the nature of the 12 zodiacal signs, however. Ancient astronomers named and mapped out the neighboring constellations, so were completely aware of their existence.

Astrologers differentiate between the Tropical Zodiac and Sidereal Zodiac. The signs remain the same in these two systems, but the sidereal zodiac keeps pace with the gradually shifting position of stars from an earth-based perspective, and the tropical zodiac fixes the signs to the seasons and movement of the sun. Western astrology generally works with the former; and Indian Astrology with the latter. Zodiac Sign

Zodiacwheel and Sun signs
Signs of the zodiac are one of the most important concepts in astrology.

They are 30-degree segments of the 360-degree circle that is the horoscope, each named for a constellation.

Etymology
The English term “sign” is derived from the Latin word “signum”, which itself was used as a translation of zōidion in the Roman period. Zoidion is the original name for a “sign” of the zodiac in Greek. Zōidion (ζῴδιον) is the singular, meaning “sign”, and zōidia (ζῴδια) is the plural, meaning “signs”.[1]

The Difference between Signs and Constellations
Ancient star-gazers in Mesopotamia recognized that the sun and moon traveled along a predictable belt, from east to west. The constellations along this pathway gained special importance. With names like the lion, the crab, the bull, and the sea-goat, the apparent zoological nature of most of these constellations gave rise to their name, the zodiac. During the 6th century BCE the Babylonians decided to use twelve 30-degree segments of the heavens that roughly coincided with the zodiacal constellations. They were very concerned to track planetary movements and eclipses, and the 30-degree segments along the ecliptic offered them greater precision. These segments are the zodiacal signs.

It should be noted, however, that some of the zodiacal constellations (like Aries) barely touch the ecliptic; and a small section of the constellation Ophiuchus passes through it. Some of the constellations (like Cancer) occupy much less than 30 degrees along the ecliptic, whereas Virgo takes up 47 degrees along the sun's pathway. So the sign-constellation correspondence has always been only approximate.

The sign names still coincide with the constellations for which they were named: a constellation and sign are both called Aries, for example. This duplication was sensible thousands of years ago when signs and their namesake constellations were roughly in the same sectors of the heavens. The Babylonians used a sidereal zodiac, as Hindu astrologers do today. With the precession of the equinoxes their signs and constellations still overlap because they are pegged to the motion of fixed stars. With the tropical zodiac used in western astrology, calibrated to the solar seasonal cycle, signs and their namesake constellations have moved considerably apart over the centuries. Zero degrees Aries marks the spring equinox in the western tropical zodiac, for example, but the sign of Aries is now in a part of the heavens roughly 27 degrees previous to the Aries sidereal sign and constellation, due to precession. Western astrologers live comfortably with both a sign and constellational Aries, but non-astrologers sometimes find the two definitions confusing.

The passing of the signs through the year is really a type of calendar, with each zodiacal "month" being approximately 30 days long. The sun's movement roughly equates to one degree per day. In the tropical zodiac zero degrees Aries begins in March with the spring equinox, followed by Cancer in June at the summer solstice. Libra begins around September 21 at the autumn equinox, with Capricorn in December at the winter solstice.

Using the Signs in Astrology
Most people know their astrological "sign" as their sun sign, or sign the sun was in at their birth. Each planet and sensitive point also has its own astrological sign, depending upon their position in the sky at the time of birth. Each planet in a sign also has its own degree within the 30-degree sign.

Each sign is classified according to its element or triplicity: earth, air, fire, and water; as well as its order in each quarter of the horoscope (Quality or Quadruplicities.) Each sign also has one or two planets that "rule" it and supposedly have a special affinity for it. A planet is strengthened if it is located within the sign it rules (Domicile.) For example, Aries is ruled by Mars; and Aquarius is ruled by Saturn (traditional) and Uranus (modern.) Signs are often related to personality-types and character traits, based upon their element, quality, and ruling planet's attributes. These are described in the articles for each sign. The constellations still seem to shed some light on the signs named for them, as well. Since the lion is the king of beasts and an emblem of royalty, sun-sign Leos are supposedly proud people who enjoy leadership roles.

Signs indicate "how" or "in what manner" a planet operates. As such, they give important clues to the individual's personality; but they are not the only horoscope feature that astrologers examine.

Under the influence of "evolutionary" astrologers like Dane Rudhyar some astrologers rank-order the spiritual maturity of signs according to their order in the zodiac. Supposedly Aries is the most primitive, relying on aggression and instinct; while Pisces symbolizes the spiritually mature soul. In reality, humans are not so easily type-cast by their sun-signs.

Mythology of the constellation
Liz Greene[1]: The image of the scales or balance can be found in the myths of ancient Egypt, where the goddess Ma'at, guardian of justice, weighed the souls of the dead against a feather to determine how free they were of the burden of transgression. The balance is also associated with Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, who has passed into modern iconography as the blindfolded female figure of justice presiding over so many courtroom proceedings.

Libra, second of the airy signs, is relatively "new", since it only made its appearance during the Hellenistic period, in the 3rd or 2nd century B.C.E. Before this, the claws of Scorpio, which in Babylon were portrayed holding the Lamp of Illumination, encompassed this segment of the heavens. Scorpio is a sign of great passion and also of vengeance, reflecting that instinctive sense of justice which demands an eye for an eye. Libra, evolving from its claws, reflects a willingness to use the faculty of reason to achieve a fair and objective judgment.

The profound change in human values, reflected by Libra's emergence, is also portrayed in the myth of Orestes, who killed his mother at Apollo's command and was then hunted by the Furies, the ancient goddesses of vengeance. Athena, opposing the savagery of their blind retaliation, put Orestes' case before the first human jury. Through lengthy discussion and a majority vote, the jury deemed Orestes blameless and set him free. Thus for the first time in myth, it is a group of human beings, not a king or a god, who determines the nature of right and wrong.

Libra, the only inanimate object in the imagery of the zodiac, symbolizes the detached perspective and the cooperative thinking which allow us to achieve a balanced and objective understanding of each other and of life.

The Greeks did not recognise Libra as a separate constellation but thought that it symbolised the pincers of Scorpius (Scorpio). The Romans were the first to consider Libra to be a separate constellation - the Sun stood there at the time of the autumn equinox, a time of equilibrium between day and night. This view agrees with Sumerian tradition.

Ancient mythology links Libra to the story of Eros and Psyche which symbolises the perfect relationship finally found after long periods of austerity and many disappointments. The queen's daughter Psyche was so beautiful that even Aphrodite was jealous of her and so she gave her son Eros the task of killing Psyche. However, on seeing her he was so overcome that he let his arrow brush against himself - the same arrow that strikes all those who fall in love. He then took Psyche to his palace and they made love under the cover of darkness, with him not allowing her to see him. However, the time came when she wanted to know who her lover was and she lit an oil lamp and looked into the face of the god of love. As she sat there some oil dropped onto his shoulder and woke him and he saw that she recognised him. In that moment Eros and his palace disappeared and Psyche found herself perched on a lonely rock. After Psyche took on many arduous tasks, including a descent into the underworld, she finally won over Aphrodite who accepted their love and allowed them to come together again.


The sign of Libra in the view of Johfra Bosschart
Interpretation
Libra is the seventh sign of the zodiac. It is concerned with consciously appraising and evaluating one's own intentions.

Libra, being an air sign, has a love of the intellect and collects information in order gain a balanced opinion of any situation. The ability to be fair can also become a burden when the strive to be objective leads to indecision. The situation is often further exacerbated by Libra's longing for harmony.

To come down in favour of something or someone also means deciding against something or someone. This violates the Libran ideals of diplomacy, tact and willingness to compromise. Under difficult circumstances this can lead to a craving for admiration where the most important thing is not to hurt the feelings of others.

The need for harmony is also apparent in the appearance of Libra individuals. They have a keen sense for all the aesthetic aspects of life. The beauty in form should express the inner beauty but can become an end in itself. For this reason, the arts play a major role in the life of Libra individuals.

Relationships to others are central in the life of Librans. They define themselves through their relationships with others, and social interaction is vital for their sense of well-being. They feel incomplete without company and the phrase "my better half" is a particularly appropriate way to describe their attitude to relationships.

Planets and axes in the sign of Libra exhibit typical Libran qualities such as harmony, diplomacy and charm.

Both Libra and its opposite sign Aries are orientated towards others. However, whereas Aries is concerned with proving its personal prowess to others, Libra strives to achieve balance in relationships. The three air signs Libra, Gemini and Aquarius all share an interest in intellectual ideas. Gemini's focus is on gathering information and being well-informed, whereas Libra is more interested in gathering information in order to form an objective opinion. Finally, Aquarius uses knowledge to promote humanitarian ideals and be of service to the greater collective of which it is a part. From the two signs that stand in square to it, Libra can learn the value of empathy (Cancer) and self-reliance (Capricorn).

Saturn is exalted in Libra, Mars in detriment and the Sun in fall.

Mythology of the constellation
Liz Greene[2]: The lion has many faces in myth, traversing a spectrum from the most vengeful and savage to the kingliest and most noble. In Leo, the second of the fire signs, the creative power of fire is banked and concentrated, producing ferocious self-centeredness or the radiant and generous warmth of the Sun, which is Leo's planetary ruler.

In Egypt, the lion-headed goddess, Sekhmet, known as the Eye of Ra, symbolized not only foresight but also the terrible anger of the sun god if his will was crossed. The rage of thwarted Leo is reflected in this ancient goddess, for in this sign the intuitive conviction of a unique destiny may produce not only great vision but also great pride and wilfulness.

The Nemean lion, which Hercules conquered, is also a symbol of Leonine intensity which, unchecked by human reason, can trample over everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the battle, Hercules wore the lion's skin as his emblem, suggesting that Leo's powerful sense of personal destiny can be a source of immense strength and creativity.

The great Anatolian earth goddess, Kybele, was invariably portrayed with a pair of lions, reflecting the creative potency of nature itself. Although savage, the lion in myth is always noble, never mean like the jackal or treacherous like the snake. Even at its most primitive, this sign possesses a magnanimity which raises it above the pettier dimensions of human nature.

The creative vision of Leo is nothing less than the conviction of one's inner divinity demanding expression through a life which is stamped with uniquely individual style.

However, in the end, Zeus, who admired the lion's strength, immortalised it with its own star constellation.

Interpretation
Leo is the fifth sign of the zodiac. It is here that the zodiac reaches its greatest splendour. It is a centrifugal force that radiates warmth.

Leo longs to give form to something. It wants to be creatively active and express its own being, whether in playful interaction with life, creative work or giving birth to children. Leo wants to make something of its talents, it wants to leave something to be remembered by. According to the psychoanalyst and astrologer Liz Greene "the greatest creation of the Leo individual should be him/herself".

Individuals with an emphasis of the sign of Leo in their horoscopes love to be the centre of attention and to allow others to bask in their glory. They like to be the Sun at the centre of their own universe around which everything revolves. For this they naturally need an audience willing to reflect back their greatness.

The danger is that Leo individuals may not be able to fulfil their own expectations. They can then resemble an elaborate facade with little substance behind it and can appear conceited, arrogant and hypocritical. As the Heracles myth shows, Leo individuals must defeat the wild animal within before adorning themselves with its attributes. Only then will they be bestowed their dignity and power. Leo individuals must earn authority during the course of their lives. The more they can achieve this, the more they can take control of their own lives and preserve their independence.

These individuals are open for the concerns of others who are less well-off than themselves. And they are ready to help whenever possible. The basis for this is their warm-heartedness but it also has the effect of reflecting back and making them aware of their own importance.


Johfra Bosschart's Leo
Axes or planets in the sign of Leo have an air of greatness and are dramatic and lively.

Leo shares with its opposite sign Aquarius an interest in the development of human potential. Leo is interested in personal development, Aquarius in the community as a whole. Leo also possesses, together with the other fire signs Aries and Sagittarius, a passionate energy. But whereas Aries channels this energy in a particular direction to initiate something new, Leo radiates its energy in all directions and warms its surroundings. Finally, Sagittarius uses its fiery energy to inspire others.

Leo can also learn valuable lessons from the two signs which stand in natural square to it. From Taurus it can learn to cope with world of concrete objects, and from Scorpio the power of transformation.

Pluto is exalted in Leo, whereas Saturn and Uranus are in fall.

Myth of Heracles
The first of the twelve labours was to slay and skin the Nemean Lion. The lion was a powerful and fearsome beast that terrorised the inhabitants of the town of Nemea by constantly demanding new sacrifices. The lion was invulnerable to any kind weapon and the only way that Hercules could defeat it was by resorting to his own - subjective - physical strength. He finally managed to strangle the lion with his bare hands. He then used the lion's own claws to skin it. He used the lion's pelt to make a cloak and wore its skull as a helmet. In this way he absorbed the lion's strength.

Mythology of the constellation
Liz Greene[2]: Twins appear in the myths of every ancient culture. Even our modern understanding of the divided ovum does not lessen the feeling of mystery surrounding two human beings who look so alike.

In Greek myth, the twins Castor and Pollux appear identical, but the latter was the divine son of Zeus, while the former was the mortal son of King Tindareus of Sparta. When Castor was killed Pollux wept bitterly over his body, for being immortal he could not follow his brother's shade to the kingdom of the dead. Zeus, taking pity on them, allowed them to alternate so that each could experience the spiritual heights and the mortal depths; yet they could never be together in either realm. Castor and Pollux were thus divided by the gulf between the realm of earth and the realm of heaven. Zeus also immortalised the two brothers as a star constellation.

Other mythic twins, such as Romulus and Remus, were divided by the gulf between good and evil. In Roman myth, these twins, sons of the war god Mars, were suckled as infants by a wolf. When they grew up Remus plotted his brother's murder, but Romulus killed him in self-defence and was honored as the founder of the city of Rome.

From Greek myth also come the twins Zethus and Amphion, divided by their sharply contrasting natures and abilities. Although both were benign, Zethus was a strong and energetie warrior while Amphion was an artist and an intellectual, skilled in mathematies and the use of the lyre.


The sign of Gemini[3]
Interpretation
Gemini is the third sign of the zodiac. It stands for the assimilation and communication of the numerous impressions life has to offer. Here perception is filtered through the intellect.

The emphasis is on the acquirement of knowledge. Those born under the sign of Gemini are interested in current events and love to be up to date on the latest developments. They are interested in a wide variety of things. They are sociable and can adapt to a wide variety of different people.

Language is very important to them and they love to read and educate themselves, and equally love to share their own ideas with others, whether through speech or by writing.

Gemini individuals also love to be on the move in order to find stimulation in the world around them.

They are sometimes in danger of scattering their energy too widely. Because they have such wide-ranging interests, Geminis sometimes tend to gain only a superficial knowledge of something before moving on to something else. This can also be a strategy to avoid confronting the darker sides and depths of their own personalities. This is the second face of this sign as indicated in the myth of Castor and Polydeuces: something which is part of an individual's personality ends up being rejected because it seems to be totally at odds with their self-image.

Gemini born individuals are keenly aware of all kinds of opposites existing in the world, whether among people or in nature or in all kinds of things and they have a talent for reconciling them: They are wonderful mediators and are able to consider a situation from the most diverse points of view. These talents mean that they are sometimes susceptible to not taking the truth too seriously.

Planets or axes in the sign of Gemini will exhibit some of the typical qualities of this sign such as flexibility, agility and adaptability.

The three air signs Gemini, Libra and Aquarius all have a certain light-touch when socialising with other people. In the case of Gemini, socialising is a way of coming into contact with as many different aspects of life as possible, whereas Libra seeks out others to balance itself and Aquarius seeks to make friends who are on a similar wavelength. Both Gemini and its opposite sign of Sagittarius are fascinated by knowledge. But where Gemini seeks to gain a more rounded understanding of life by accumulating as many facts as possible, the aim of Sagittarius is to create a more holistic vision of life. From the two signs that stand in square to it Gemini can learn the value of attention to detail (Virgo) and emotional empathy (Pisces).

Agriculture
Astrology has an ancient association with farming and gardening. The moon is the operative planet. Although dates when the moon is in the water signs and some of the earth signs are considered most fruitful for planting, the barren signs are all valuable for tasks that destroy something (like pests,) harvesting, or routine farm chores.

Aries: a barren sign, but would be good for "destructive" tasks like weeding and plowing the soil
Taurus: generally a Fruitful Sign, as the sign of Venus and the exaltation of the Moon
Gemini: barren, but would also be good for destroying weeds
Cancer is the most fruitful Sign, as a water sign ruled by the Moon, and the exaltation of Jupiter
Leo: barren, as the sign of the Sun, it is considered too dry
Virgo is a barren sign. As Lilly put it: "for Mayds of themselves produce no Births." Virgo is also a good sign for weeding and planting flowering (non-fruit producing) vines
Libra: moderately fertile, as the domicile of Venus and exaltation of Saturn. Libra is good for planting flowers and vines
Scorpio: as a water sign, it is fruitful
Sagittarius: termed a fruitful sign by Lilly, because ruled by Jupiter. As it is a fire sign, moon-sign gardeners today consider it to be at best semi-barren. It is useful for planting members of the onion and garlic family, however
Capricorn: A semi-barren sign. Crops planted when the moon is in Capricorn may not be very productive, but will be hardy and drought-resistant
Aquarius: Lilly considered it to be semi-barren but moon-sign gardening manuals today refer to this sign as barren
Pisces: Very fruitful, as a water sign and the traditional domicile of Jupiter

Virgo as depicted in Urania’s Mirror[2]. Despite this voluptuous depiction, Virgo is a barren sign
Human Reproduction
Gemini, Leo, and Virgo are the truly barren signs used in traditional astrology when forecasting a woman’s fertility. Supposedly one of these signs on the cusp of her first house or fifth house of children; or the lord of the 5th house in a barren sign, caused sterility or limited her number of children. However, they are not accurate simple indicators of infertility, as many women with these placements have children. Today, in modern developed nations with low birth rates and new infertility medical treatments, the barren signs probably would not reliably indicate family size.

Bibliography Double-bodied sign
Jump to navigationJump to search

The Elements in alchemical representation
Synonym: Double Signs

In ancient astrology, the double or dual-bodied signs refer to the zodiac signs in the mutable cross:

Gemini: they consist of two different human beings, usually identified as Castor and Pollux.
Virgo: the Virgin is seen as composed of a woman and a bird[1]. In earlier depictions, the Virgin was also shown with wings (angelic). Claudius Ptolemy describes, for example, the influence of fixed stars in the "wing" of the Virgin (see under Virgo).
Sagittarius: The Archer is a Centaur, thus a dual being of human and horse.
Pisces: The Fishes are two fish, as can be clearly seen in the constellation Pisces.
In this definition, the Capricorn does not belong to the dual-bodied signs despite its constellation, the Sea goat.

Interpretation
In Election, their adaptability makes these signs the ideal choice for situations where flexibility and avoidance of rigidity are essential. In other words: when an event should not result in rigidity. However, when flexible adaptation to changing circumstances is desired, the double signs are the right choice.[1] Decade

In populat astrology, a decan refers to the subdivision of the periods that the Sun spends in a zodiac sign into three roughly equal parts, usually ten days each. The intention is to assign those born within a decan to a decanate (10° segments of a sign), thus achieving a more precise differentiation of the characteristics of the zodiac sign bearers.

The division into calendar days does not always allow for an accurate assignment of the decanates; in the boundary areas of a decan, the assignment of the decades can be erroneous.

In forecasting, decades are typically used to narrow down the transits of the planets and lights to the Sun Signs, which form the basis of the forecast in trivial astrology, although transits can still occur within an orb of up to 10°—which can also lead to weakened or erroneous statements. In serious astrology, transits are usually considered effective for orbs of 1° to a maximum of 3°. Parallel connection

Notably, the Parallel Connection occurs through reflection along the Axis from 0° Leo to 0° Aquarius: this involves the reflection of the signs onto each other, which share the same Classical ruler (see Thema Mundi)[1].

Manilius has illustrated further Parallel Connections in his Astronomica in Book 2[2] that are hardly applied in today's classical astrology:

Reflection along the axis 15° Aries - 15° Libra: Hearing Signs
Example: Aquarius and Gemini listen to each other.
Reflection along the axis 15° Cancer - 15° Capricorn: Seeing Signs
Example: Gemini and Leo look at each other.
Reflection along the axis 0° Taurus - 0° Scorpio: Loving signs
Example: Leo loves Capricorn, but Capricorn meets Leo with cunning.
The editor of the translation, Wolfgang Fels, has presented these Parallel Connections very clearly in the following graphic (Mirror axis added later):

Spiegelachsen.gif
Manilius' motivation to address and illustrate these connections was his observation that human friendships, dislikes, love, alliances, teachings, and learning among the signs can be explained by them, as well as who sees whom and who does not - which cannot be explained by the otherwise considered connections between the signs, such as:

Triplicity
Gender
Polarity
Quality
Assessment
Although these Parallel Connections are not widely regarded today, it is worth considering incorporating them into the assessment of relationships in the horoscope and examining to what extent Manilius' observations can be profitably applied in the interpretation of interpersonal connections.

Loving Signs
For example, the "loving" signs are interesting in the Quincunx and Semi-Sextile connections, which are otherwise only referred to as Peregrine in classical astrology: Manilius explains that here only one-sided positive ambitions exist, which are often not reciprocated by the second involved sign or at least not in the expected manner.

This provides hints on how Peregrinity arises and possibly how it can be dealt with. The Quincunx and the Semi-Sextile are also assessed ambivalently in modern astrology, and Manilius presents a possible solution approach.

Hearing and Seeing Signs
Through the hearing and seeing signs, or through their parallelities, Manilius also finds a very nice explanation for the Cardinal quality of the four signs Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn:

Aries and Libra only listen to themselves and no one else.
Cancer and Capricorn only look at themselves and no one else.
These four signs thus have fewer connections among themselves than the other signs, making them more self-reliant and realizing the guiding impulses from within themselves, without looking to the right or left: this is predominantly what characterizes the essence of Cardinality.

Ruler Parallelism
The Ruler Parallelism is still recognized in classical astrology today and is actively used. Even where the "new" planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are included, the classical planets are at least still co-rulers in the ruling signs of the new planets. However, this way, the relationships of the respective signs, in which the same planet rules, are less considered: for example, the relationship from Taurus to Libra, the two signs of Venus. Manilius' work can also provide an impetus to delve deeper into the relationships of ruler parallelism. Scorpio

Mythology of the Constellation
Liz Greene[2]: The Scorpion of Greek myth is a menacing creature, sent by the lunar goddess Artemis to kill the hunter Orion as a punishment for his pride. It also caused the disastrous bolting of the steeds of Apollo, as they galloped wildly across the heavens when his inexperienced son Phaethon tried to commandeer the solar chariot: the earth was scorched and Phaëthon was hurled to his death.

In early Mesopotamia, the Scorpion was known as the Stinger, the symbol of darkness which heralded the decline of the Sun's power in the autumn. It is thus connected with the chthonic powers of nature, which will rise up in anger if abused by the arrogant will of human beings. Both Orion and Phaëthon were guilty of what the Greeks called hubris - the pride which afflicts heroic souls, and makes them push beyond their appropriate limits to challenge the will and power of the gods.

Although portrayed in myth as a dangerous creature, the Scorpion is not evil. The symbolism of the second water sign reflects the vengeance of outraged nature, and the stern justice which awaits those who lack humility in the face of the instinctual forces of life. As harbinger of the Sun's decline, Scorpio embodies the law of nature which decrees that even the strongest will must ultimately bow to the body's mortality.

The image of the Scorpion was also adopted by the Roman Praetorian Guard as their emblem, in part because one of its planetary rulers is the war god Mars (the other being the underworld god Pluto), and in part because the cunning, speed and lethal sting of the scorpion reflected the image these crack troops of the Empire wished their enemies to bear in mind.

The myths connected with Scorpio are closely related to the primitive hunter Orion who was both libidinous and a keen hunter. After he raped his mother in law he was blinded by her husband King Oinopion but regained his sight with the help of the divine blacksmith Hephaistos. He then immediately went about avenging himself by attacking all of nature. Artemis, the Moon goddess of the wilderness, the hunt and wild animals, was so worried that Orion would destroy the animal kingdom that she created a giant scorpion which killed Orion with one sting. In another version, it is said that Artemis created the scorpion in self defence because Orion tried to rape her. Whatever the case, the primitive hunter was killed by a creature that is itself considered to be one of the oldest and most primitive creatures.

Because of their animosity towards each other, the constellations of Orion and Scorpio never appear in the night sky at the same time.

Interpretation
Scorpio is the eighth sign of the zodiac. It is also considered to be one of the most enigmatic signs due to the wide variety of ways in which it can find expression.

Whether a Scorpio person feels driven by instincts or takes on the form of a phoenix and rises to the highest heights, he/she is always able to go through a process of regeneration and start something completely new. This individual lives passionately and intensely but it requires a high level of maturity in order not to destroy those things he/she covets or loves the most.

Individuals with an emphasis of this sign tend towards extremes of behaviour. Their motto is often 'everything or nothing'! Others are rarely aware of their intensity of feelings because no matter how much they might be simmering inside they can put on a calm facade. Their intensity often drives them to devote themselves totally to any social causes they feel passionate about, and they tend to make a dramatic impression while doing so.

They are interested in anything which seems profound or mysterious, for taboo themes and the depths of being. Their interest is awakened where others turn away in horror or disgust.

The subject of power in all its subtle and covert forms is of great significance. They may believe that by manipulating others they have have power over them, but this only leads them into the very state of dependency they so dread.


The sign of Scorpio in the view of Johfra Bosschart
Finally, Scorpio individuals possess great powers of healing with which they can help not only themselves but also others.

Planets and axes in the sign of Scorpio have a profound and intense quality.

Scorpio and Taurus are both passionate signs, but whereas Taurus is passionate about experiencing the sensual aspects of life, Scorpio is passionately interested in getting to the bottom of existence. The water signs of Cancer, Pisces and Scorpio are all very intuitive and empathic. Cancerians are very empathic towards their loved ones. Scorpio can sense where others are vulnerable and use this ability to either hurt or heal. Pisces feels at one with all of humanity and ultimately nature itself. Scorpio can learn valuable lessons from the two signs that stand archetypally in square to it: From Leo, Scorpio can learn to express its innate energies, and from Aquarius it can learn to use these in a constructive manner for the good of society.

Uranus is exalted in Scorpio, Venus in detriment and the Moon in fall.

Comparison & Insights
Trait	Leo	Gemini	Scorpio
Element	Fire	Air	Water
Quality	Fixed	Mutable	Fixed
Polarity	Yang (Masculine)	Yang (Masculine)	Yin (Feminine)
Focus	Self-expression, leadership	Knowledge, communication	Depth, transformation

Shadow	Pride, ego	Superficiality, distraction	Obsession, secrecy
Life Challenge	Master personal power	Integrate duality and depth	Transform intensity into healing
💡 Quick Mythic Takeaway:

Leo is your heroic, radiant sun energy – bold and kingly.

Gemini is your curious, dual-minded messenger – adaptable and nimble.

Scorpio is your phoenix energy – intense, secretive, regenerative.

In practical terms, Leo gives you charisma and authority, Gemini gives you intellect and social dexterity, Scorpio gives you emotional depth and transformational power. Combined, they could represent a personality that is dynamic, aware, and capable of shining, connecting, and transforming simultaneously—but only if the shadows are consciously managed.

If you want, I can make a visual map showing the mythic and energetic relationships between Leo, Gemini, and Scorpio so you can see how their energies “talk” to each other across the zodiac—it’s pretty enlightening.

Do you want me to do that?

Ah, you’ve pulled up an extensive fixed star catalog! This is essentially a reference for astrologers who work with traditional or sidereal fixed stars rather than just the planets. A few quick points to make sense of what’s here:

Columns & Data:

Name / Catalogue – the traditional and Bayer/Flamsteed designation of the star.

Mag – apparent magnitude (brightness), lower numbers are brighter.

Ecliptical Latitude – distance from the ecliptic in degrees north or south.

Positions (1900, 1950, 2000, 2050) – the zodiacal longitude of the star at those years, since stars have proper motion and precession shifts them.

Nature (Ptolemy) – classical astrological nature (planetary correspondence, e.g., Mars, Saturn, Venus).

Examples:

Aldebaran (α-Tauri): 9°47’ Taurus in 2000, nature: Mars — associated with courage, honor, and sometimes aggression or conflict.

Regulus (α-Leonis) — not in the snippet you pasted, but traditionally 29°28’ Leo in 2000, nature: Sun — royalty, authority, leadership.

Algol (β-Persei): 26°10’ Taurus in 2000, nature: Saturn/Jupiter — notorious as the “demon star,” tied to extreme intensity, danger, or crisis.

Patterns:

Many stars in Aries/Taurus during 2000–2050 due to precession.

Planetary nature indicates the flavor or energy of the star in astrology. For example:

Mars/Saturn: action, struggle, conflict, ambition

Venus/Mercury: charm, intellect, art, communication

Jupiter: luck, expansion, higher purpose

How to Use It in Astrology:

Look for conjunctions with planets or angles in a natal chart — these fixed stars amplify or tweak planetary meanings.

Or consider them in electional astrology for timing events, where a star’s nature might enhance or complicate a choice.

If you want, I can turn this huge list into a condensed reference table by sign, highlighting the most influential stars astrologers tend to actually use for natal or synastry work. That way, you won’t have to sift through hundreds of entries every time.

Do you want me to do that?

Astronomy
A self-luminous celestial body. More specifically, fixed stars are gas spheres. Groupings of fixed stars form the Constellations.

Fixed stars are distinguished from the so-called wandering stars, the Planets.

The proper motion of fixed stars is very small; the changes in their celestial positions relative to the tropical Zodiac are mainly due to Precession.

Significance
Describing their astrological nature or effect is not straightforward, and it is usually given as a correspondence of a combination of several planets. Classical Astrology often describes a rather threatening, often violent effect of fixed stars, which can easily instill fear and terror. However, this only partially reflects the nature of fixed stars; historically, it may only concern particularly striking events that were recorded and shaped the image we have of the effect of the fixed star.

For example, Algol is considered - from a classical perspective - one of the most malevolent celestial bodies. Upon closer examination, however, very positive effects can also be found: it grants stability, strongly encourages finding and adhering to one's life purpose; then it can even bestow fame. However, if one does not recognize their life goal, or if circumstances prevent its realization, seemingly negative, malevolent events manifest.

While classical astrology, based on Claudius Ptolemy, transmitted a certain hard, fact-based interpretation, modern interpretations have shifted significantly towards a psychological significance of fixed stars.

In an interpretation, only very small orbs should generally be used; also because fixed stars often lie quite close together. An orb of only one degree is recommended, with a maximum of 1.5 degrees for important fixed stars.

In Aspects, Conjunction is preferred, while Opposition is rarely considered. Particularly important are the conjunctions with the Luminaries, the sun-near planets, as well as with Ascendant and Medium Coeli.

Astronomy and History
Bright stars have been used for visual orientation since the Neolithic and grouped into star clusters. In ancient times, they were interpreted mythologically and associated with mythical figures, animals, or objects.
A well-known example is the Great Bear (Ursa Major), part of which is also referred to as the "Big Dipper," whose two pointer stars indicate the direction to the North Star.

The stars of such a constellation appear to have small angular distances from each other when viewed from Earth and seem to be close together. However, this proximity is only apparent: by measuring Parallax, the actual distance of individual stars from the Solar System can be determined, and it can vary significantly among the stars of a constellation. Thus, stars can be farther apart from each other within the same constellation than from our Sun. Conversely, two stars from different constellations can actually be closer to each other than seemingly adjacent stars of the same constellation.

An international agreement was reached (IAU, 1922) on the current 88 constellations. However, there are numerous patterns that are not officially recognized by the IAU, or constellations[2] that have only local or historically cultural significance, such as in Indian and Chinese astronomy, or among the Incas and Australian Aboriginal peoples.

Constellations can be found in almost all cultures and can be traced back to early civilizations. Human-like figures (see, for example, Orion), triangles to hexagons, and longer star chains (like Andromeda or the Hydra) or star streams (e.g., Eridanus) play a special role.
In any case, constellations were an important means of orientation at night and were particularly significant for navigation.

Today's constellations trace back to twelve Babylonian and ancient Egyptian zodiac signs, which were expanded to 48 in ancient Greece. Almost all can be found in Ptolemy, the authoritative figure for the Middle Ages, who described them around the year 150 in his Almagest. He, in turn, referred to Eudoxus[3], a Greek astronomer from the fourth century BC, who introduced Babylonian astronomy into Hellenistic culture.
Historical traces of thirty of the figures reach back to the Bronze Age. The twelve constellations that lie on the Ecliptic serve as the basis for the astrological Zodiac Signs.


The constellations and "signs" sketched astronomically
The Hair of Berenice (Coma Berenices) goes back to the influential star catalog of Tycho Brahe (in the year 1590). The current constellation was known in antiquity as an Asterism, but was not considered a standalone constellation, rather as part of the lion's tail.
Similarly, the traditional constellation Antinous was initially seen as an asterism or part of the eagle. It was only in modern times that it was recognized as its own constellation.[4]

Petrus Plancius introduced four additional constellations around 1600. Johann Bayer also added twelve new figures in his Uranometria of 1603. Seven new constellations can be traced back to Johannes Hevelius (late 17th century). Nicolas Louis de Lacaille expanded the southern sky by another 17 around 1750. Finally, since 1922, only 88 constellations are internationally recognized, with their boundary lines officially defined in 1928 based on the work of Eugène Delporte.

The constellations around the South Pole cannot be observed from north of the equator[5], and were only established during the Age of Discovery (late 16th century). Of the 88 modern constellations, 36 are predominantly in the northern sky, while the remaining 52 are mainly in the southern.

Within a constellation, individual stars are given Greek letters (α, β, γ, δ, ε, etc.) in order of their brightness.

Difference Between Constellation and Zodiac Sign
As can be seen, the twelve ecliptic constellations have different sizes, meaning they have different lengths (Elongation) on the ecliptic. This has historically led to the problem of aligning these constellations with the zodiac signs, which are all defined to be exactly 30° long (the twelve divisions of the Zodiac of 360°). The Sidereal Zodiac especially faces this difficulty, as its signs should ideally coincide with the constellations: a precisely defined zero point, that is, a fixed point at 0° Aries on the zodiac, cannot be clearly determined. Therefore, there are also different values for the Ayanamsha, which refers to the degree of the shift of the defined Tropical Zodiac compared to the Sidereal Zodiac.

The constellations shift with the Precession relative to the tropical zodiac, approximately 1° every 72 years. Thus, over 1900 years after Ptolemy, the constellations (and thus the Sidereal Zodiac) and the Tropical Zodiac, which is oriented to the spring equinox (Equinox), have shifted by about 25° relative to each other.

From this, critics of astrology often draw the incorrect conclusion that astrologers are working with the wrong zodiac signs: for example, a Leo is actually a Cancer, because at the time of their birth, the Sun would have been in front of the constellation Cancer. However, this argument is not correct. After all, (tropical) astrologers refer to the zodiac signs derived from the spring point, not the constellations.

Astrological Significance
The oldest complete assignment of constellations to astrological interpretations comes from Claudius Ptolemy. In his Tetrabiblos, parts of constellations or the entire figure are compared with the influence of one or two planets in combination.

However, it should always be kept in mind that the division of the sky into specific constellations—unlike the Tropical Zodiac—is actually "arbitrary." Christine Keidel-Joura: "We should consider that these are primarily projections of human imagination and observation, representing symbols, stories, and parables. It is noticeable that other cultures recognized entirely different images in the star constellations than ours. For example, the Chinese saw a granary in our constellation Whale, while the Koreans saw a storage place for heavenly troops. It is therefore advisable that even today, in the exploration and interpretation of constellations, we place special emphasis on allowing them to intuitively affect us, perhaps even discovering new symbols and then recognizing which themes and stories truly fit the respective constellations."[7]

Through modern astronomy, we know that the stars of a constellation that appear to be close together from an earthly perspective are often very far apart. Additionally, there have been shifts in the assignment of individual fixed stars to a constellation over the centuries. Some images were added, while others fell out of use. The significance of the astrological influence of a constellation, as far as it is derived solely from the image itself, can thus be considered relative. It does not have to be fundamentally incorrect, but there is no secure source for how these assignments originated. Some hypotheses suggest that the Moon Houses and Decans were the source of the description and interpretation of the constellations. Others, like Geoffrey Cornelius, recognize in them essentially a mythological or projective significance.

Since individual constellations overlap concerning the ecliptic, and thus intersect from the perspective of the ecliptic projection, a false precision is suggested in the listing of fixed stars, as provided in the Fixed Star List, which is not fundamentally present. This can be recognized when comparing which constellation a particular fixed star belongs to and that its influence description (or classical "nature") derives from the respective constellation.

Overall, this is a reason to also consider the respective ecliptic Latitude (height) of the constellations to arrive at a more substantiated statement. Some astrologers question the relevance of including fixed stars at higher latitudes (i.e., far from the ecliptic), while others insist on their projection onto the ecliptic, even if a star, for example, lies at 60° north or south latitude.[8] It is generally assumed that—besides the ecliptic zodiac signs—especially those constellations that are located in the same celestial hemisphere (northern or southern) as the location of the horoscope being examined are particularly effective.
ChatGPT said:
Ah, you’ve got a really thorough set of notes on fixed stars, constellations, and their astrological significance. Let’s break this down and clarify it in a way that connects both the astronomy and astrology perspectives, because that’s where it often gets confusing.

1. What Are Fixed Stars?
Astronomically:
Fixed stars are self-luminous gas spheres (like the Sun, but much farther away). They don’t “wander” like planets—hence the name “fixed.” Their apparent positions change very slowly over time due to precession (~1° every 72 years).

Astrologically:
Each fixed star has a symbolic or psychological influence, often tied to classical interpretations of events. For example:

Algol is famous as a “malevolent” star but can also symbolize focus, life purpose, and even fame if the person aligns with their destiny.

Influence is strongest when a star conjuncts the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or Midheaven.

Orbs are very tight: usually 1°–1.5°, because stars are clustered closely in the sky.

2. Constellations vs Zodiac Signs
Constellations are clusters of stars forming recognizable patterns (Orion, Ursa Major, etc.). They’re uneven in size.

Zodiac signs are exactly 30° divisions of the ecliptic—this is the difference between tropical astrology (season-based) and sidereal astrology (constellation-based).

The misalignment between constellations and signs is what leads to debates like “Am I really a Leo or a Cancer?” — tropical astrologers answer “Leo” based on the season, not the actual constellation behind the Sun.

3. Historical and Cultural Notes
Many cultures had their own constellations and interpretations:

Chinese: Granary in the Whale constellation

Koreans: Storage for heavenly troops

Babylonian & Egyptian roots: Basis for the 12 zodiac signs

Constellation boundaries were only officially defined in 1928 (IAU).

Stars that look close together may actually be light-years apart.

4. Astrological Application of Fixed Stars
Classical astrology often gave a hard, sometimes fearful interpretation. Modern astrology leans more psychological: destiny, purpose, personal challenges.

The most potent aspects are conjunctions; oppositions are less emphasized.

Stars far from the ecliptic can still be projected onto it for influence, but some astrologers question their relevance.

The location (northern vs southern hemisphere) can enhance or diminish their influence depending on the chart’s place of birth.

5. Key Takeaways
Fixed stars are real celestial objects, but their astrological interpretations are symbolic and culturally layered.

Constellations are patterns humans imposed, zodiac signs are precise divisions along the ecliptic.

Modern astrology focuses on psychological, karmic, or life-purpose meanings rather than literal “doom and gloom.”

Precision matters: tight orbs and conjunctions are crucial for practical astrological work.

If you want, I can make a visual map showing the key fixed stars, their constellations, and how they line up with Sun, Moon, and Ascendant for interpretations—that’s extremely useful for chart work.
